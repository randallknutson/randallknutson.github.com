title: Canadians and Durian
---
We've been doing our best to keep the 27 Canadians (really 25 Canadians and 2 Americans) all fed.  They've really been enjoying the food although some have said it is a little spicey.  Today I was going to bring them some durian to try.  But as I was about to leave, Adrian from Panga showed up with a ton of durian to bring out to them.  So we went out there and tried to get them to eat it. That involved me eating a ton of durian and trying every trick in the book to convince them that something that smells that bad and tastes like rancid gym socks can actually be enjoyed.  So with a taste of heaven and a smell from hell, I convinced a few of them to nibble at it.  I managed to down about 3 whole durians.  One of the best parts about durian is that it sticks with you for a while because every time you burp, you taste it again.  Oh, and it makes urine smell really funny.
