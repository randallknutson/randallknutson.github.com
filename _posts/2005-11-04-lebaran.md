The month of fasting has just finished up here with the celebration of Lebaran.  Lebaran is kind of like Thanksgiving, 4th of July, Easter and Christmas all rolled into one holiday.  Huge feasts, fireworks, fancy new clothes and presents are all parts of the fun.  This year it seems the gifts of choice for young boys is BB guns and laser pointers.  Everywhere I go now I see kids running around with very real looking guns shooting things.  Either that or pointing a laser at me. Hopefully it will get old soon.
