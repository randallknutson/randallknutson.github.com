I missed it a couple of days ago but July 29th marks my four years here in Indonesia.  Its amazing to look back at who I was then and how I have changed since.  Funny how I only have a few more days left till I leave permanently.  Seems like just yesterday.  Sigh...<br /><br />If you want to read about all that has happened since I arrived, it is all contained in my newsletters that stretch the entire time.  Tons of stuff is also included in the last two years of this blog.  Interestingly enough, the last month was also the two year anniversay of this blog.  <br /><br />I'm going to be taking off to the beach for a week so I'll be out of contact starting monday but I have a couple of random posts I've been mulling over in my head for a while that I'll try and post before then.
