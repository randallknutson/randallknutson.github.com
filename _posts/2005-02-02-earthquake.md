title: Earthquake!
---
We had an earthquake here at school today.  Apparently there have been hundreds of small quakes around the region since the big one.  It was a small one and just bumped the desks around and made me feel dizzy.  Don't worry about tsunami's here though.  We are at around 4000 feet elevation.  I'm more worried about the several active volcanos within a few hours of here, one is only a 30 minute drive away and I love going up there to visit.
