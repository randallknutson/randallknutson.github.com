Stephen and I have spent the last few days on Perhentian Kecil Island after an overnight bus trip from Kuala Lumpur.  We decided to go after dropping our passports of at the Kazakhstan Embassy and being told that we would have to wait till friday to pick them up.  We decided instead of hanging around KL for a whole week, we might as well head to the beach.  Everyone said Perhentian Kecil was the best so we headed there.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Perhentian2-766911.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Perhentian2-765418.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Here is a picture of the beach.  The main beach, long beach, is a really beautiful white sand beach with lots of cheap bungalos and moderately priced restaurants lining the shore.  There is also a path across the island to coral bay.  Coral bay faces the west so it has a great view of the sunset.  Our first night there we hiked the 15 minutes across four dinner with a view of the sunset.  It was all well and good until we started heading back and realized we forgot our flashlights.  By then it was very dark and the path went through the woods and over the central hill.  We decided to just do it in the dark.  What an experience that was!  We had to go pretty slow and rely on our other senses to feel where the path was.  Along much of the path though was phosphorescent fungus that glowed.  The cool thing was that it was on each side of the path only so we just had to walk down dark part with the glowing on each side to find our way.  <br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Perhentian1-732351.JPG"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Perhentian1-730611.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />The next day (yesterday) we decided to rent a kayak and paddle around the island.  Kecil means "little" but don't be fooled, the island wasn't small.  It took us about 4 hours to go around the island and we were paddling pretty quickly the whole time.  When we got to coral bay on the opposite side from where we started, we pulled in for a half hour break and saw a few guys sitting around.  We went up and started chatting with them and they, like many others, love the fact that we speak Bahasa.  We were quite thirsty by then and saw they were drinking green coconut milk which is very good and refreshing.  We asked if we could buy some to which they told us that they don't sell it but they had just cut some down and they would love to give us some.  Needless to say it was very tasty.  <br /><br />This morning we took it easy, partially because we are both a little sore from the paddling and partially from the fact that the disco next door was pumping bass until 2 in the morning.  We hopped the ferry back across to the mainland and are now waiting for the night bus back to KL.<br /><br />Friday we're going to pick up our passports from the Kazakhstan Embassy and then Saturday head to Thailand.  Our first stop will either be Bangkok or the Bridge on the River Kwai.  I love the movie and have always wanted to see it.
