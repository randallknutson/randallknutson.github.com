So today I spent inspecting houses and trying to find a new location to build houses.  Besides getting upset with the village leader for not showing three times and finally telling him he had to come to my office tomorrow or I wouldn't consider building houses in his village, there are two notable things that happened.<br /><br />First, in the two main villages that we are building in right now, there is a crazy guy who wanders back and forth between the two yelling at the moon, stars and whatever else gets in his way.  Today while we were eating lunch he stopped by for a yell.  We heard him coming for about 15 minutes and I was pleasantly amused when he came up to us.  I greeted him and shook his hand which threw him off for a few minutes but soon enough he was back at full volume yelling in my face.  I just smiled till he got bored and found some chickens to yell at.<br /><br />Secondly, today was a payday where we pay the carpenters for houses that are completed and the homeowners for helping.  I must admit that I was close to tears as we handed over the keys to a brand new house to an 8 year old boy who is the only surviving member of his family.<br /><br />I love my job!
