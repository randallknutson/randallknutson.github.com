Here's an e-mail from one of my roomates.  This is so Indonesia.
<br />
<br />I was sitting in Yopie Salon at Bandung Super Mall getting my hair cut (ok, a creambath, but a hair cut sounds more masculine) when I looked at their calender and it was a picture of my Junior High School in NH.
<br />
<br />It was pretty far away, so I kept looking at it in the mirror.  Once my "hair was cut" I went over to it and said, "that is my hometown in NH" - that is a picture of my old Church, my Junior High and the field I use to play baseball (typical NH beauty with all the autumn leaves and pumpkins)...  They said "you're from Italy".  I said, "no, that's NH" - they said "but the calender says that's Italy".
<br />
<br />I then turned to February and they had a picture of snow covered mountains and penquins and the caption said "Canada".  I told them "there aren't any penquins in Canada, the editor just guessed where these pictures were from".  I asked if I could buy the calender and they said "No" but hey, if you're at Yopie in BSM - look at January to see my Junior High School.  It was the coolest thing.
<br />
<br />Peace, Pete
