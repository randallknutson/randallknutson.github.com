I finished up with the third season of 24 last night.  It was by far the best season with tons of twists and turns.  Don't worry.  I won't spoil anything.  I gotta say, killing off Jack at the end... Oh sorry.  He doesn't really die.  But anyways.  It is good to have that done with.  3 days is a long time to be watching a show.  Now we can move on the other things, like For Love or Money 3!
