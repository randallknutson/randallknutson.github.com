I'm on my way this morning and will be gone traveling for the next four months or so.  I won't have my laptop with me most of the time so my posts are going to become a bit more sparse but I'll try and post whenever I get a chance.  I'm headed to Medan this morning and then on to Kuala Lumpur this evening to begin getting visas for all the countries we're headed to.
