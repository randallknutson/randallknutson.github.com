By the way, I have a new job!  I sent out a newsletter to everyone but it is official now so I can announce it.  I'm the new Livelihood Project Manager for Samaritan's Purse and I officially start on the 5th of August when I arrive from Singapore back in Banda Aceh.  I'm really excited to be working this job with a great organization.
