So true to form, it rained both Saturday and Sunday.  Luckily there was a break for a few hours on Saturday so I went to the beach and got a few rays of sunshine before heading back.  Just when I got back it started pouring again.  I wasn't so lucky today for Ultimate Frisbee.  We had been playing for about half an hour when it started pouring.  We stopped the game due to the really high wind and I offered to give a friend a ride home before I remembered that he lives on the other side of town from me and the field we play at.  So I drove him home on my motorcycle in the rain and got even wetter than I was.  The upshot is that My bike got a good cleaning from the rain.  I guess I did too.
