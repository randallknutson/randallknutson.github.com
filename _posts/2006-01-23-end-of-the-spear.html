My parents went to see the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399862/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9dGhlIGVuZCBvZiB0aGUgc3BlYXJ8ZnQ9MXxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8Y289MXxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=1;ft=20;fm=1">End of the Spear</a> yesterday.  I really hope it comes to Medan and I can see it when I'm there.  There aren't any movie theaters here in Aceh due to religious reasons.  Anyways, my parents really enjoyed the movie and from what I've heard from other friends as well it is one of the best movies of the year.  <br /><br />The story of the 5 missionaries murdered while reaching the Waudani people is one of my favorite of all times and I've really enjoyed reading "Through Gates of Splender" by Elizabeth Elliot, one of the widows.<br /><br />Since I can't watch it I did the next best thing and that is to read the reviews.  I was a little shocked to see that all the "professional" reviews on the sites were negative, calling the movie "Bungle in the Jungle," "attrociously scripted and edited" and even worse.  When I started reading from people that watched the movie though, almost every one was extremely positive.<br /><br />Why is this?  Might be a combination of factors.  First of all, it is a non-Hollywood movie which means the "establishment" may be against it.  Second it is a movie about missionaries and Christianity, neither of which are very popular in the entertainment world. <br /><br />Anyways, from everything I have heard and read, it is an awesome movie well worth seeing that is being slammed by the big movie industry.  Check it out for yourself.
