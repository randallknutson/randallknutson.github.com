title: Carrying on the tradition
---
Last night at Thanksgiving dinner we had about 23 people there and in the tradition of the first Thanksgiving, it was a mix of cultures.
<br />
<br />We had:
<br />1 Indonesian (Muslim) family
<br />1 Korean family
<br />1 Canadian family
<br />1 American Family
<br />1 person from Indonesia
<br />1 person from Holland
<br />1 person from Canada (but born in Texas! He emigrated)
<br />3 singles from America
<br />
<br />Quite a mix and a lot of fun.  The food was out of this world too.
