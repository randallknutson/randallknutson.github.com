Here in Indonesia, fried chicken is a favorite among fast food.  Even MacDonalds has fried chicken and rice.  There is also Popeyes, KFC and the most inexplicable Texas Fried Chicken.  I cracked up the first time I saw a Texas Fried Chicken since we DEFINITELY don't have them in Texas.  Since then I've learned that it is another name for Churchs Fried Chicken.  I guess having a restaurant named Church's in a predominantly Mulsim country is not the smartest marketing idea.  There is also a California Fried Chicken but it is a local ripoff of KFC and TFC and tastes terrible.<br /><br />Check out some pictures.<br /><br /><img src="/sites/default/files/blog/bl-texas1.jpg" /><img src="/sites/default/files/blog/bl-texas2.jpg" />
