title: Water Wierdness
---
The water at our house has been acting up the last few weeks.  First, the pump has been running nonstop since the night with the strong lightning storm a few weeks ago.  For a couple of days, we have only hot water at the house.  Normally this wouldn't seem that odd except we don't have any central water heater.  All of the water that is coming from the well is steaming hot.  I can only think of a couple of reasons for this.  First, it could be that the pump running non-stop has heated up the water.  It could also be that there is a new volcano developing below our well that is heating all the water.  I'm not sure which.  So, in case idea one was correct, I turned off the pump for a night and turned it back on in the morning.  Sure enough, the water was cold but for some reason, both of our independant water heaters wouldn't work.  Aargh!  First I go from there being only hot water to now there is only cold water.  Things seem to have stabilized now as the water heaters are working again and the cold water is actually cold.  Hopefully we don't end up with a new mountain in our backyard.
