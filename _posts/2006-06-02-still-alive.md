title: Still Alive

For all of you who have been wondering, I'm still alive. I've been working 18 hour days since I got here in Jokja and am very exhausted.  Only one more day till Sunday though.  The city of Jokja is still in pretty good condition so I've been staying at a pretty nice hotel during the day and going out to the rough areas all day long.  Then of course there are the meetings.  <br /><br />Lots more to say but I have to go eat.
