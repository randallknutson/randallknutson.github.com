title: Wherefore art thou Jackie
---
Yesterday one of my roommates and our friend went out to see the latest Jackie Chan movie...  and well, before I relate my experience, let me give you a brief recap of my history with Jackie.
<br />
<br />I grew up catching glimpses of Jackie Chan movies and hearing his terrible accent and I, like so many others, though his movies were some of the worst things I had ever seen.  That's saying a lot since I'm a <a href="http://www.mst3kinfo.com/">MST3K</a> fan.  My second roommate in college was a pretty strange guy.  We had a lot of differences, such as, I like <a href="http://www.coke.com">Coke</a>, he likes <a href="http://www.pepsi.com">Pepsi</a>.  He was also a huge Jackie Chan fan.  Of course I made fun of him for a while and then he talked me into watching one.  Now, I have this policy that says you can't knock something unless you have tried it (I do have a few exceptions such as necrophilia).  This explains why I was a vegetarian for one semester at college.  By the way, it sucks.  Anyways, we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111512/">The Legend of Drunken Master</a> and I was expecting to make fun of it the whole way through.  I was amazed by Chan's ability to convey comedy with martial arts and an intelligent story.  I later have seen a documentary on martial arts in movies and they talked about how after Bruce Lee died, no one could top him because he was the best.  Chan decided to make it comic since he could do it faster or better than Lee.  From then on I was hooked.  Some of his films have been better and some a little worse but they are all enjoyable for Chan's clown like style of fighting and creative use of props.  I've even enjoyed big(er) budget productions such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184894/">Shanghai Noon</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300471/">Shanghai Knights</a>.
<br />
<br />So, yesterday morning we wanted to see a film and checked what was showing.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386005/">New Police Story</a> is the only one that sounded interesting (the other two were REALLY bad Indonesian movies). At first my roommate and I were a little hesitant because we thought it might be in Chinese with Indonesian subtitles.  Our friend is Chinese-Indonesian and he assured us that it was in English so we went.  I've got to say, my respect for Jackie has dropped quite a bit after this film.  First of all, it WAS in Chinese with Indonesian subtitles.  Luckily all of us can read Indonesian fairly well.  Secondly, Jackie Chan played a character who is a drunk policeman who can't fight and keeps getting beat up by teenage miscreants.  After watching Jackie continually beat up people in other movies, it was difficult to watch him get beat and beat decisively time and again in this film.  It was also a little unbelievable.  Oh how I longed for the comic fights with crazy outcomes that don't involve Jackie causing all of his friends to be killed by not being able to beat a 15 year old in fighting!
<br />
<br />This movie was definitely not made for a western mind.  It was stylized in the classic Chinese way of flying through the air but not overly.  Fight scenes and gun battles were impeccably unrealistic and the love stories didn't make much sense.  We have a mysterious side kick that picks up the comic relief, however badly, that we finally figure out who he is in the last scene of the movie.  As an amateur editor, I would have placed that scene much earlier to add more emotion instead of tacking it on the end.
<br />
<br />Overall, it was a lot of fun.  This was mostly because I only understood about 70% of the dialog and was able to laugh with/at my Chinese friend throughout much of the movie.   Should you go see this movie?  If you are looking for a date night, definitely not.  If you like MST3K, have a Chinese friend to see it with and have it available with subtitles you don't understand, I would say go and see it but don't pay too much.
