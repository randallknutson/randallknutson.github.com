title: Spiffy new site
---
If you can read this than you can see my new site.  It is quite a bit better than the last one.  I have changed the entire look and feel, added daily news and comments (via blogger) and updated much of the information.  I have also gotten rid of a few sections that I don't think anyone ever looked at.  I still need to do a few more things to get it working.  I need to move it into my domain, write a couple more chapters in my autobiography and add some recent photo albums.  I'm going to keep this news site pretty up to date this time.  Last time it was too difficult to update regularly.  Much easier this time.
