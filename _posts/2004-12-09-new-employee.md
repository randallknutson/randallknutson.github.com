I have hired a guy named Ray to be a computer service technician.  He is about 42, married and knows his computers.  Yesterday was his first day and the internet computer broke the night before.  We spent the whole day rebuilding the computer which also didn't work so we started over from a computer out of the science lab and then finally it worked.  We also made some major changes that should hopefully make our network more robust, faster and more secure.  I hope he will be a great addition to our school.
