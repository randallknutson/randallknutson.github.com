We finished off the last day at the drug rehab/mental health clinic yesterday for Week Without Walls.  I was very happy with how the students responded to going there.  They really enjoyed it and interacted well with the people there.  I think a lot of our students are tired of learning and want to start doing.  This gave them a small opportunity to do just that.
<br />
<br />We had a full group of 22 on Thursday and it was a little overwhelming for the people there but yesterday we had only 8, including me and Pete.  This was really nice to have a smaller group.  In the morning we played volleyball with the people, then we ate lunch with them and then they had a program set up for us!  They danced, then had us dance and sang.  I taught them the macarena since that is the only dance I can sorta do.
<br />
<br />There is a guy there that we called the laughing man.  His favorite thing is to come up to you, ask a question and walk away laughing.  His second favorite thing is to play chess.  I've never actually won a chess game that I can remember so I don't like to play very much.  He kept asking us all morning to play so finally I decided to play him.  I was playing my hardest and was up by only one pawn when I noticed that he was crying softly.  I felt really bad and started trying to lose but he was so shaken he wouldn't take any of my pieces.  I then accidently checkmated him.  I felt so bad that I made the laughing man cry.  I tried to play him again to be able to lose but he wouldn't do it.

<br />Next week is back to the grind...  with walls
