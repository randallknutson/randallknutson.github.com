The last two nights I went to BAIS's production of "Lost in Yonkers" by Neil Simon.  They did a really great job with it.  I had read it before but didn't think it was very funny until I actually watched it.  Of course it is very serious as well.  The second night had some suprises like one of the main actresses fell off a motorcycle on her way to the performance and apparently broke her arm.  They put it in a sling and she performed without missing a beat.  One of the characters also partially undresses for bed on stage.  Since this is the last night he decided to take his pants off as well.  He had basketball shorts on underneath but the director just about had a heart attack.  Very well done and I enjoyed both nights.
