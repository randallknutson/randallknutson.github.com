Fox news is running a story on <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,196264,00.html">Six Health Woes That Ruin A Date</a>.  It goes into detail on how these six things can ruin a date and what to do about them.<br />  <br />1. Bad Breath<br />2. Sweat<br />3. Gastrointestinal Woes<br />4. Allergies<br />5. Acne<br />6. Warts<br /><br />What struck me about this list is how superficial it all is.  I mean, when trying to find someone you want to spend the rest of your life with, how important are these things really?  Just about everyone has dealt with all of them at some point in their lives.  Some will become even bigger problems as we get older (see number three).  Hopefully we will be looking for something more than whether a person has allergies or not.<br /><br />This made me think of Six Spiritual Health Woes That Will Ruin A Date.  I mean, when I meet a girl and get to know her, I am looking for much more important things than if she has bad breath (I think we all do in the morning).  This list is very convicting to me because I don't do nearly as well on it as I do the list above.  I think it would be better if we worked on getting this list right instead of the other one.<br /><br />1. No Relationship with Jesus<br /><br />In marriage it is important to not be unequally yolked.  What this means is that the two people need to be on the same page with the same mission and vision in life.  If not, there are going to be a lot of headaches.  Part of having a relationship with Jesus is realizing that we are citizens of heaven and not earth.  Our hopes, goals and treasures are there and not on earth.  If someone does not have a relationship with Jesus, they are going to have a very different view on how to live life.<br /><br />There's good news though!  Anyone can have a relationship with Jesus and it is really easy. <br /><br />"Salvation that comes from trusting Christ--which is the message we preach--is already within easy reach. In fact, the Scriptures say, 'The message is close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart.'  For if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."  Romans 10:8-9<br /><br />2. Selfishness<br /><br />Being overly concerned with oneself is a major turn off.  Being in a relationship is about caring about the other person and helping each other.  Nothing can be more poisonous to this than a selfish person.  <br /><br />"Jesus replied: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"  Matthew 22:37-39<br /><br />If everyone, especially those in a relationship, loved their neighbor as themselves, the world would be a much better place and a lot more relationships would be better off.<br /><br />3. Conceited<br /><br />For those of you who aren't sure what conceited is (I had to look it up to make sure), it is "holding an unduly high opinion of yourself, vain."  Basically it is the type of person who is so concerned with how they look that it is more important than anything else.  Having to spend an hour and a half in the bathroom getting ready every morning.  <br /><br />While there is nothing wrong with looking good (it certainly can be a very good thing!), there is a time and a place for everything.  There is nothing wrong with showing the real you every once in a while and not worrying if everything isn't perfect.<br /><br />4. Disregard For The Sanctity Of Marriage<br /><br />This are only special if they are made special.  Special means something that is above common or usual.  If we make something common then it is no longer special.  This is especially true in things related to marriage.  I'm not going to say any more on this subject except to say that things made special are a bit more... um... special.<br /><br />5. Laziness<br /><br />Again, a relationship is about working together.  No one wants to work with someone who is lazy.  That means that they have to do all the work.  It is much better to find someone who wants to share the load.  <br /><br />"If a man is lazy, the rafters sag;<br />if his hands are idle, the house leaks" Ecclesiastes 10:18<br /><br />Much better to be responsible for cleaning up after yourself and being involved in volunteering someplace.<br /><br />6. Easily Angered Or Annoyed<br /><br />Being comfortable with someone is very important and if you are always worried about angering or annoying someone by something you say or do, a relationship isn't much fun.  Much better to be comfortable with someone and able to be honest with them without worrying about the reaction.<br /><br />Now there is a time and a place for anger when something goes wrong but it is best to not happen very often and only when appropriate and it needs to be dealt with with grace and peace.  It is much better to be quick to forgive even if the other person is in the wrong.<br /><br />"A patient man has great understanding,<br />but a quick-tempered man displays folly." Proverbs 14:29<br /><br />"A man's wisdom gives him patience;<br />it is to his glory to overlook an offense." Proverbs 19:11<br /><br />(Please note that this list was written with no one in mind except myself)
