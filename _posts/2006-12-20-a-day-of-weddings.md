title: A Day of Weddings
---
This Sunday was a day full of weddings.  After church we went to the first one.  My sister-in-laws father got married to another widower.  It was a great ceremony and they looked really happy together.  After the reception and a 30 minute break, we went to the next one.  The second one is the sister of some friends.  After that we went home and watched the end of The Santa Clause 2 which has a wedding (sorry if I spoiled the ending!)  It definitely felt like a theme for the day.<br /><br />In fact, while I was traveling  on the last trip, it seemed like everywhere we went there were weddings going on.  In Central Asia, the big custom is to get your wedding video made around the national monuments and famous buildings.  While we were sightseeing we constantly had weddings going on around us.  At some places we could count 7 brides or more.  Also, along the roads people were videoing the processions from the back of hatchback cars.  Seems like lots of people want to get married all over the place.
