Sorry I haven't posted in a few days.  I moved up to Banda Aceh and am taking over the shelter project up here.  I've been incredibly busy since I got here but am starting to figure things out.  I've been meeting everyone, inspecting procedures and hiring people for positions that are still vacant.  I'm really excited about this opportunity.<br /><br />We have an inaugeration today for a village of 35 houses that are already finished.
