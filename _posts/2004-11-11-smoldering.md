We seem to have identified most of the broken stuff on the network.  The internet is now working again (after a new power supply and network card).  The damage done was a lot less than last time but still annoying.  Most stuff is covered under warranty and insurance so we should be okay.  We still have a few teachers without internet but there aren't many.

<br />Tonight is the final rehearsal before the drama tomorrow night. Hopefully things will go well and I can go home early.  We will practice until we get it right. Can't wait for the weekend.  We have all next week without school.
