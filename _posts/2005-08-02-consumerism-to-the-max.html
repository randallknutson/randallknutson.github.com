I've decided to write a bit of a critique of Singapore from what I have seen in the last few days.  Singaporians really attempt to model themselves after the US though so most, if not all of this probably is applicable to the US as well.<br /><br />Singapore is known as Asia's shopping center and it shows.  Everywhere you go there is stuff to buy and helpful slogans encouraging you to buy.  There are two main things that seem important to the people, improving the state of Singapore and improving their own life.<br /><br />Here are some of the slogans I've seen:<br />Its about me, me, me.<br />The future is ours to build.<br />How well does it fit you?<br /><br />There were many more slogans like this that stun me every time I see them.  Basically they portray the advancement of mankind and Singapore and how important consumerism is to Singapore.  It is SOO important for people to keep buying because if they don't, the economy will collapse.  If Singaporians had to rank the important factors in their lives, it would look something like this: Singapore, Self, God, Job, Family, others.  Singaporians have given up many freedoms and rights in the name of security and success.  They are also incredibly self centered when it comes to getting ahead.  If we follow the teachings of Moses and Jesus, we should love God first and others second.  It really saddens me to see an entire nation so focused on getting their state ahead and then seeing themselves get ahead and <span style="font-style:italic;">then</span> they start thinking about God and others.  <br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Singapore isn't a terrible place.  On the contrary, it is like a piece of America plopped in the middle of Asia.  The problem is just the general focus of the people on things other than God.  One thing Indonesians have going for them is their devotion to their religion, not money.
