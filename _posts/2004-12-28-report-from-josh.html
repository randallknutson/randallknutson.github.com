Here is an e-mail I just got from Josh.  I can't summarize it so I'll just post it.
<br />
<br />E-Mail:
<br />hey everyone, first let me thank you guys for all of your prayers and heartfelt e-mails. I sit here just overwhelmed by the love you guys have shown me during this stressful time. I know some of you on this list may not have heard that mark and I were in phi-phi when the tsunami hit the island. I know that many of are probably wondering what happened and I wish I could tell you face to face but that will have to wait until this summer. I am going to try and recount as best as I can remember what happened for those forty hours after the tsunami hit the island. I will preface what I am about to say with this. It was the most horrific thing I have ever experienced on every metaphysical level you can imagine. We saw things that I hope none of you live to see. Most of you know that I love to tell stories and tend to embellish but trust me when I say there are not words that can communicate some of the things that happened. This account will be as accurate as I can be without being to graphic. It may sounds as rambling sometimes so bear with me. I am still struggling to put it all together in my own head so I have no idea how this will come out.
<br />
<br />it was about 10:30 on the morning of the 26th and mark and I were waking up. As I was laying in bed I heard what sounded like a train coming in the distance. My first thought was there isn't a train on this island. It got louder so went out on the patio of this little bungalow where mark and I were staying. It was on the side of a hill so we could only see a little of the valley but could not see the beach. As I opened the door I saw a huge wave of debris and water rushing through the valley and people were screaming and running for the hills. I yelled for mark and he jumped out of bed and we just stood frozen for about a minute. I saw people running up the hill and the I saw that there were people at the edge of the debris and out in the middle of it. I looked at mark and just said we have to help. We ran down past screaming wounded people and tried to get a sense of what we could do.
<br />
<br />as I was on this old rickety boardwalk, I just started laying down and trying to pull people out the water. We both just tried to get as many people up as we could. I noticed ahead of me two girls we looked like they were hurt. They were sitting in the reception area of our bungalow on the floor about ten feet from all the debris. One of them was badly cut and bleeding on her arm and leg. I told them to wait there and ran to get them some first aid stuff we had in our room. I came back and tried to bandage them up, gave them some clothes so wear ( most of the people were hit so hard that the wave tore their clothes off), some water to drink and took them to higher ground. Mark stayed with them to make sure they were ok and I went back to trying to help. Over the next hour I helped some other guys pull out a guy with a broken back and a pregnant women who was buried under the debris. When I saw that women was pregnant. Me and the guy next to me just sighed "oh shit."
<br />
<br />the water began to recede quickly. I ran out to the flood plain. There where people stranded on trees, roofs, water towers. There a few of us out there trying to bring them back in to higher ground. They were absolutely freaked out and took some time to coax them down. We had no idea if there was another wave on the way. In the moves, the star boldly strides forth with little fear or regard for personal safety. That is bullshit. As I stood out there a couple hundred yards from the water front I was terrified that another wave was coming. If it did I had no where to run. As I and others who were healthy enough tried to bring in the people who were too injured or scared to run I was constantly fighting my own cowardice. I wanted to help because I knew it was the right thing to do but the drive for self-preservation was telling me to back to my bungalow on the mountain top and stay were it was safe. We managed to help some people back to the make-shift first aid area which was the reception area at the place we were staying at. All the while there were people screaming out trying to find loved ones; people just slumped over with no expression on there face and people sobbing because their friends were dead.
<br />
<br />after I came back to the safe area a saw all the injured people. I found mark and another British guy and we decided to go to the other side of phi-phi and try to find some water and first aid supplies. With a wary eye on the tide we ran across and brought back some water and first aid supplies. I tried to find the girls that we had helped earlier and see if they were alright. They seemed ok. Mark and I went up to our bungalow and found family sitting on the balcony. They had a little baby girl with them. She was first person I saw smile. They were fine and told us how they were
<br />on the beach and managed to run away from the wave. I went back down to see more people needed help but it was just chaos. Their were people every where. Some hurt, some helping, some not doing anything at all. Some were taking pictures and I know they did not mean anything buy it but I could not believe they would sit there and take pictures will others were struggling to pull people to safety. I went into the first aid area and there were people all over. I wanted to help but was just paralyzed because I did not know what to do. There were two nurses and several other people helping the wounded. I went back to the bungalow and just sat down. My head was spinning. I tried to pray but what are you supposed to pray? God, thanks that I am safe? But why me and not the others? I just ask for protection, wisdom and the strength to help others. I knew that you all would be praying for me and that helped.
<br />
<br />after just sitting unable to ovecome the shock we heard the sound of helicopters. A while later someone yelled that they were picking up the wounded at some of the beach spots. Mark and I ran down to the first aid place and said we would help carry people down. The next four or five hours were the worst of the entire experience. I have never in my life been more physically exhausted in my life as we tried to carry one guy literally around the island, through the debris and rubble to the where we thought the helicopters would land. everyone told us a different place and we wondered back and forth without a clue; just going in circles. From one place to another, we could not find where the helicopters where landing. As we stood there with three of the wounded trying to figure out what to do some idiot runs past us and yells "I heard on the radio that another wave is heading this way in fifteen minutes." the injured started freaking out. Me and another girl told him in no uncertain terms to "shut the fuck up" and then we said that we had heard rumors of another wave all day and that it probably wasn't true.
<br />
<br />I tried to sound convincing but I wasn't. I was standing on the beach (hippies bar for you have been to phi-phi) about ten feet from the water. I looked at mark and others we were trying to help the wounded. We all had no idea what to do. There was no way the five of us could move three wounded bodies to safety. We either stuck it out with them or ran for cover like just about everyone else seemed to be doing. I have never in my life been more afraid. I wanted to grab mark and make a run for it. First we had no idea where the helicopters were; second I didn;t think they would make it anyway and lastly I thought about my parents and all of you. What if I never got to see you again? Then I thought, but what if this guy laying with half a leg gone, bleeding to death was mark? What if it was me? Mark and decided to try and find someone else to help us carry this guy to another possible landing sight which was on the other side of the island and we had to walk across the beach to get there.
<br />
<br />the wave never came and we finally made it to the landing area. Is was about 5:00 and mark and I grabbed some water and headed back to our place to rest. Now I know it may be easy to read this and think that it might make me sound pretty good. But as I walked back others ask me to help them carry someone and I said no. I just didn't have the strength to do any more. I spent the rest of the night just in total shock, at times just thinking and at other times just fighting back tears because there was so much hurt. We had more than most people and I wanted to do more. I felt guilty for all that I had when other shad nothing. I felt guilty (and sometimes still do that I didn't do more). I find myself looking at the guys next to us who were all healthy, who I never saw lift a finger and tried to feel like at least I tried. You see, the reality is that people just handle stress and shock differently. I guess some can't do anything and others just try to keep busy. There were other that I am sure did more than I did with what they had. I don't know what I am trying to say or justify right now. I guess I am trying to honestly to share with you guys my moments of strength and weakness, when I could have done more. I realize it may not make sense to you and I have started to ramble.
<br />
<br />there is so much more I could tell you. There were times when we laughed with others and times when I used everything in me not to cry. That night and the next day were just unreal but I could write for ever. My head is spinning right now. I hope this helps you guys in some way. I have couple pictures that we took when we were leaving. We stayed as there as until all the people who could be moved to safety were moved. It in no way can really communicate the scope of the damage but it might give you some idea. Please send this e-mail around. I don't have everyone's address so this would help. I love you all. Josh
