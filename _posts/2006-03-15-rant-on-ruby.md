title: Rant on Ruby
---
Sorry for most of you who wont have a clue what I am talking about but I just need to rant a little about Ruby, the programming language.  I have very fond memories at how easy Ruby was to learn in college for basic stuff and so every time I want to write a simple program to solve a problem, I start with Ruby.  What I always forget is that every time I do, I get frustrated by a couple of limitations that always end up making me switch to another language.  Those limitations are the lack of multidimensional arrays and a deep recursion stack limit.  I always seem to run up against those limits.  I've done it again and will try Python.
