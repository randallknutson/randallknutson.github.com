Today about 15 reporters came to the women's center in Meulaboh and interviewed me and some other people there.  Reporters really can be quite nosey.  I think they really liked the place and I'll be looking for newspaper reports about the center in the news. Almost all of the really big newspapers were there.  Quite exciting.
