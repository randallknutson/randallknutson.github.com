title: Beginning the Fish Ponds Project
---
Today we started digging the new fish ponds for the people in Gampong Lhok.  I went out there to check it out.  We hired a trackhoe to do the digging.  They are lots of fun to watch.  The operators are amazing.  They are able to use the shovel as if it is part of their body.  He can dig about 4 ponds in a day which are 20x8 meters.  We will be doing between 30 and 40 ponds for them that were destroyed by the Tsunami and helping them stock them again.
