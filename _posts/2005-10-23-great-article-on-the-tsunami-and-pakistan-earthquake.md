title: Great article on the Tsunami and Pakistan Earthquake
---
There is a great article on <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,173031,00.html">FoxNews</a> by a journalist who has covered both the tsunami in the Indian ocean and the earthquake in Pakistan.  I think it is really amazing that these natural disasters have both happened in places that were closed to the outside world and having full scale guerilla wars (Kashmir, Aceh and Sri Lanka).  The way these places have opened up are incredible.  I know many people that have been trying to get to Aceh for 30+ years but have been unable to.  Now we are having sunday services here with a room packed with 50+ people.  This is just in a small city in Aceh.  If you had told me that this would happen a year ago I wouldn't have believed you. <br /><br />Another good thing that the reporter points out is the response of the people to the US aid.  Many of the people in Aceh and in Kashmir and Pakistan were told how evil Americans are.  Now that they are actually meeting us, they aren't thinking that anymore.<br /><br />And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. - Rom 8:28
