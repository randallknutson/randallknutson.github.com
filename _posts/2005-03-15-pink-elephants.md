We are taking Doxycycline medicine which is an Anti-Malaria medicine for our time in Aceh.  The fun part is that there are a lot of crazy side effects.  I'm pretty sure I've got two.  The first is really crazy and vivid dreams every night.  I almost never dream but I have really been dreaming since I started taking it.  The second is that it has made me very emotional.  For those of you who know me, this is a huge change.  I feel like crying all the time which is not something I usually do.  No pink elephants yet though.  You never know with these drugs.
