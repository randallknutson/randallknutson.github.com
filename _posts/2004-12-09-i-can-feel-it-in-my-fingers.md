Christmas is almost here and I am beginning to notice.  Today is the Elementary Christmas Program which is where all the little people dress up in bathrobes and do their thing.  I made a movie of Luke 1:26-35; 38 using some of the students for the drama class.  I really like movie making.  Tomorrow night is the staff Christmas party which is what I am making lefse for.
