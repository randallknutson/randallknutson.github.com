Since I only spent one day in each city and didn't do anything photo worthy, this will be a short post without pictures.<br /><br />I went to Jakarta from Bandung on Thursday morning, catching a ride with a friend who was going down for a meeting.  I met up with some other friends who now live in Jakarta and we went to the mall together.  Two highlights of the trip are that we ate Krispy Kreme doughnuts for the first time and saw Snakes on a Plane.  <br /><br />I bought stock in Krispy Kreme a while ago when it was really low and have been stubbornly holding on ever since.  I figured that the doughnuts were really good and it was low priced.  I had never tasted them before though until Jakarta!  They were everything they were cracked up to be and then some.  There is another company that has been moving in before them called "J-Co" that is very similar but the doughnuts don't taste nearly as good.  Go Krispy Kreme!<br /><br />Snakes on a Plane was definitely interesting. It was a lot of fun to watch it with my squeamish friends.  I don't think I have laughed so hard in a very long time.  There was some very gratuitous violence in the film that was hard to watch but overall it was very funny.  If you do see it, make sure to bring someone squeamish with you.  It enhances the movie very much.<br /><br />Friday morning I flew in to Medan to pick up Stephen (finally!) and to say goodbye for the last time.  I met the new country director who is a really cool guy and had dinner with the Medan staff as a going away party.  They also gave us some signed tsunami books to remember our work in Indonesia.<br /><br />Then Saturday morning we flew to Kuala Lumpur where we currently are getting our Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan visas.  That means our trip has officially begun.  More to come later.
