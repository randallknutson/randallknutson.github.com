title: A Little Bit of Christmas

Its hard to believe it is already December 14th.  Here in Aceh they don't celebrate Christmas so it is kind of sneaking up on me.  I had a great suprise yesterday though.  I came back from a long road trip to inspect some flooded houses and found a package from another SP base had arrive.  Inside was a miniature Christmas tree complete with lights and tinsel!  I have set it up in the office and now I'm reminded it is nearly Christmas.  Before that the only sign was when I was in Medan a couple weeks ago and they were playing Christmas music in the mall.
