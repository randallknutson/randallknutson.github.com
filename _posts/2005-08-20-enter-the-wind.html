I've managed to pick up a bit of a cough the last couple days and it is making me feel quite miserable today.  I think part of this is because of the air conditioner in my room.  I'm so used to not haveing one that the dryness and coldness is killing my lungs.  It is interesting that Indonesians believe in something called "masuk angin" which means you catch a wind.  At first I thought this was ridiculous until I realized that we catch a cold, equally as ridiculous.  Either way, I'm not feeling very well.
