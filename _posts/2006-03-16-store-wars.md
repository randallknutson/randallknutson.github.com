Okay, I'm a huge fan of organic foods.  Now what I mean by that is probably NOT what you are thinking.  <br /><br />Here is the main definition of Organic:<br /><br />Of, relating to, or derived from living organisms.<br /><br />Organic is the antithesis of synthetic, which means produced in a lab from chemicals.  Pretty much everything we eat is technically organic except maybe water.  The term has been hijaked lately to mean food grown in a certain way.  Really, anything grown or gotten from a living organism is organic.  That means that ALL eggs, fruits, vegetables and meats are organic.  Technically, gas and oil are also organic since they are derived from living organisms.  That is why we designate some oil as synthetic, because it doesn't come from living organisms.  It is created artificially in a lab.  Maybe some oil producers should start marking their oil as "organic."<br /><br />Thats my rant about Organic Foods.  All that being said, the following is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while.<br /><br />Be sure to watch <a href="http://www.storewars.org/flash/index.html">Store Wars</a>
