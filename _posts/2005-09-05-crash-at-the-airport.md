title: Crash at the airport
---
I just got a message from a colleage on her way to Singapore that the flight before her crashed on takeoff out of Polonia Airport here in Medan.  It was a Mandala flight and right now it doesn't look good for the people on board.  I was going to be on a flight this afternoon out to Meulaboh but the airport may not be open by then so I might have another night in Medan.
