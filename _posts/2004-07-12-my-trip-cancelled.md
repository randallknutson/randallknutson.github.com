title: My trip cancelled
---
I had been planning a trip to Fordate island in Maluku this week but it has been cancelled.  I was going to visit my friends, the Marshall's.  In order to get there though I would have had to travel through Ambon which is restriced to travel.  I needed to get a Surat Jalan (Travel Certificate) from the police before I could go but I wasn't able to do that in time.  I'm still headed out on the BIC Youth Tour on the 23rd of July.
