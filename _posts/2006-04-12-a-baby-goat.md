title: A baby goat
---
Yesterday I discovered a little goat that had just been born in the unfinished house next to ours.  It was bleating and the mother was cleaning it.  I watched it try to stand for about 10 minutes before it finally almost made it.  Here is a picture of the very young goat.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Baby Goat-725153.png"><img style="float:left;cursor:hand;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Baby Goat-722582.png" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />On a side note, I'm getting two goats and a cow for the inauguration coming up in a couple weeks.
