title: Motorcycle mishap
---
Yseterday I wrecked my new bike for the first time.  I was traveling pretty slow when a motorcycle came out from no where.  I didn't get hurt except for bruising my wrist and my bike recieved just a little damage. I had all the broken parts replaced and fixed within an hour so no harm done.  Luckily I was going pretty slow for once.
