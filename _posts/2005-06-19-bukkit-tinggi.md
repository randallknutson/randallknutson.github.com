Bukkit Tinggi is a backbackers dream destination.  It is easy to get to (two hour bus ride from Padang) and packed with things to see and do including an old fort (what's left of it), a zoo, war museum, cultural museum, huge clock in center of town, tons of cheap hotels, lots of great Padang food all within a short walk around town.There are also great trecks to villages, mountains, volcanos and lakes all around.  I wish I could stay longer.  I want to come back with some friends and spend some more time here. They even have a fast internet cafe!
