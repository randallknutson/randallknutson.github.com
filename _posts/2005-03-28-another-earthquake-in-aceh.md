title: Another Earthquake in Aceh
---
There was another earthquake (gempa bumi) in Aceh today.  So far it has been measured as a 8.7 which is huge.  There was no tsunami though which is a good thing.  As I mentioned in my last newsletter though, there will still be very heavy damage from the earthquake.  Last time it damaged and destroyed many buildings.  Keep the Acehnese in your prayers.
