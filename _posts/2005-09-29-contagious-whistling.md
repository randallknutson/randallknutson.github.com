title: Contagious Whistling
---
I've discovered something over the years.  Yawning isn't the only thing that is contagious.  Whistling is as well.  Every time I get the urge to whistle, it seems that someone else joins in within about 5 seconds.  This makes it really awkward to continue whistling.  Sometimes I can't even remember if I started or if I am following the other person.  Give it a try sometime.  If there are people around, start whistling and see if someone else starts as well.
