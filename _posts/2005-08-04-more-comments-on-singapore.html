Here are a couple of funny signs that I have seen and remember:<br /><br />In the bathroom next to the urinals was a sign that said,<br />"Our 'aim' is to keep the toilet clean.  Your 'aim' will help."<br /><br />On a patch of grass about a quarter of the size of a football field was the sign,<br />"Public Land: Enter at your own risk."<br /><br />Risk of what? It is a patch of grass you can barely throw a frisby in.  I guess you are out of luck if a meterorite hits you while you are on public land.<br /><br />One thing Singaporians are very good at is making it convenient to give up your money.  When I bought my digital video camera in Indonesia I waited around for 30 minutes trying to pay while they ran my local credit card, visa electron and my two foreign credit cards, visa and discover.  After several attempts, copies of my passport, visa and drivers licenses shipped to their boss and trying to call my bank in America to confirm my visa card, they finally came to the conclusion that I couldn't use any of them.  I had to go down five flights of stairs to an ATM machine and pull out all the money in cash and give it to them.  In contrast, in Singapore they don't even look at my credit cards.  They know they will work and charge it before you are really sure you want to purchase it.  Oh, and they accept any kind of cash you have.  In Indonesia they will only exchange perfect 2001 $100 bills without any marks or folds on them.  If you hold one edge and it doesn't stand stiff like it has been in a wallet, they won't take it.  We actually "launder" the money by starching and ironing to get it to where they will accept it. In Singapore it doesn't matter what shape it is in, they will take it.<br /><br />Finally, while I was eating breakfast this morning, I was watching a crosswalk with cops standing at it.  Many of the pedestrians were crossing when the walk light was red.  The cops were pulling them over and giving them tickets.  The funny part was that they kept doing it!  People just kept coming.  <br /><br />I'm headed back to Indonesia tomorrow. I've purchased tons of stuff and had a great time.  I'll fill you in more later.
