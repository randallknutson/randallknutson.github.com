This is the first time in my life I've ever had to really search for a job.  I had a basic idea of how it worked but this weekend I bought some books just to make sure I was doing it right.  I purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0071411054/qid=1110244487/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-5053434-5226533?v=glance&amp;s=books">The Resume.com Guide to Writing Unbeatable Resumes</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580086152/qid=1110244591/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-5053434-5226533">What Color is Your Parachute?</a>  Both have proved to be good reads and packed full of advise.  The first one, Writing Unbeatable Resumes has step by step instructions on how to write a powerful and attention grabbing resume and includes many examples for different professions and how to change careers.  One thing I found very interesting about this book was the difference between a chronological resume and a functional resume.  Functional resumes are basically where you show off your skills instead of your work experience and are great for career changing job searches.  The second book, What Color is Your Parachute?, tells you what to do once you've got your resume.  Turns out "papering" the town with your resume only gives you a 4% chance of getting a job.  Ouch.  It has plenty of helpful tips though on how to go out and get a job.<br /><br />I highly recommend both these books for anyone looking for a job.  I'll let you know how my job hunt goes.
