After having lived in several countries and learned several different languages, one of the things that really strikes me as funny is the way different languages perceive the sounds that animals make.  Teaching students from several different countries it is always fun to ask them what sounds a certain animal makes and listen to the different responses.  Not the best use of a computer class but fun none the less.  Here are some funny examples:<br /><br />Rooster:<br />English: cock-a-doodle-doo<br />Chinese (Mandarin): gou gou<br />Indonesian: kikeriku<br />Korean: kko-kki-yo<br />Thai: ake-e-ake-ake<br /><br />Cat:<br />English: meow<br />Indonesian: ngeong<br />Japanese: nyaa<br />Chinese (Mandarin): miao miao<br />Korean: (n)ya-ong<br /><br />Toke Gecko:<br />Indonesian: toke <br />Japanese: tii-tii <br />Thai: took-gae took-gae<br /><br />Bee:<br />English: bzzzz<br />Korean: boong-boong (/wing-wing) <br />Norwegian: sum-sum <br />Japanese: bunbun<br /><br />For lots more fun with world animal sounds, check out <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/ballc/animals/">Sounds of the World's Animals</a>
