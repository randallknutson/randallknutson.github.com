A month ago our house was in the middle of some nice fields.  Since then people have started building 5 houses around ours.  I mean, right next to on each side.  Pretty soon we'll be in the middle of a neighborhood.  So today a truck asked to use our driveway to turn around in since the road is barely wider than one vehicle.  I said yes and he entered our parking area.  Because of the weight of the truck and all the sand it was carrying, it sank into the ground.  Here's a picture of the truck.  They are shoveling the sand out so they can lighten the truck enough to jack it up and get it out.  Gotta love our soft driveway.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/stuck truck-719567.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/stuck truck-717450.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
