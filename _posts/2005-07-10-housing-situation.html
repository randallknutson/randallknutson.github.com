For the last couple of weeks I had been staying with a friend who had a house rented through the 10th of July.  On friday as I was on my way back from Meulaboh, i got two smses (text messages on my phone) at the same time.  The first one I opened up and it was my friend saying that he was giving the house back to the owner that day and that I needed to move out.  The second one was another friend who said he was leaving for the US and needed someone to watch his house for a month.  Amazing!  So now I've moved in to the second house and out of the first.  I plan to stay there until I go back to Bandung at the end of this month to renew my visa.
