I'm not a huge TV fan but I have to say, I'm hooked on the show <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0285331/">24</a>.  My roommates and I started watching it about a week ago and have been completely hooked ever since.  I was very skeptical because I had seen a little bit of the earlier episodes when it first came out and wasn't impressed.  It might have been that I was unwilling to have the week long wait between episodes.  I'm very impressed this time around although an overnight wait between 4 episodes is still too much for us.  The story is very gripping and incredibly long.  We should finish it up tonight and be back to our normal lives... at least until we borrow season 2.
<br />
<br /><b>Update: </b> We finished.  I have to say the series, as a whole was very entertaining and quite addicting.  The fast paced nature of the show, plenty of action and a well written script made for a fun, but long, watch.  The theme of kidnapping got a little tiring and unbelievable.  After the 10th one or so it just got repetitive.  I won't ruin the ending but the plot of the last few episodes is remarkably similar to the beginning.  The very last episode was the worst in my opinion but I will reserve final judgment until I watch the second season since it is tied in to it.  There were several things in it that just didn't work.  Overall I would have to say that the show was very good.  I can't wait for the second season and I hear there is no more kidnapping in it.  I would give them a B+.
