I have helped many people recently because their computers are slowing down and they are getting more and more ads.  I'm going to tell you what I always tell them.  Internet Explorer (The big blue E you click on to start the "internet") is not secure and allows people to install <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware">spyware and adware</a> programs on your computer without you even knowing about it.  Don't believe me?  Try this:
<br />
<br />Download and run the following programs:
<br /><a href="http://www.download.com/Ad-aware/3000-8022_4-10214379.html?tag=pop">Ad-aware</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-Destroy/3000-8022_4-10289035.html?tag=pop">Spybot: Search and Destroy</a>
<br />
<br />These programs will tell you how much bad software you already have installed.  It will also remove it for you.  Note that Norton, Macaffee and other Anti-Virus companies cannot block them because they aren't viruses.  How do you keep them from coming back?  You can keep running Ad-aware and Spybot and hope that stops the programs.  You can keep closing all thos annoying pop-up windows, or you can switch to Mozilla Firefox!
<br />
<br />Why would you want to switch?
<br />1. No more pop-ups
<br />2. No more spyware and adware
<br />3. No more Ads on websites
<br />4. Less security holes
<br />5. Tab browsing (realy cool, check it out)
<br />6. Cooler webpages (standard support)
<br />7. It's free
<br />
<br />The Department of Homeland Security even is <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=74&amp;e=3&amp;u=/cmp/20040702/tc_cmp/22103407">recommending that people switch</a>!
