Today was the Lord of the Rings Marathon for our youth group, hosted by me.  We used the school's auditorium, new ceiling mounted digital projector and sound system to make it almost like a real theater.  All three extended movies together were about 12 hours long.  I am always exhausted after watching them all.  Good fun though.
