This weekend we have the First Annual (Or More Often) BAIS Golf Tournament.  I guess I'm getting in to this whole golfing thing.  We'll see how well I do.  Right now there should be between 8-12 people showing up.  We even have a sponsor!  I can't reveal details on that since it is a suprise.  Oh, and I went to the driving range the other day and actually figured out how to drive the ball.  Everyone said I swing like a baseball player but I could hit it over 200 yards straight which apparently is pretty good so I don't care what my form looks like.
