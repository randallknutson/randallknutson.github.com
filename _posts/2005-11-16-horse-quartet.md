I've discovered a new extension to Firefox.  I've seen it before but never bothered to use it yet.  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=138">StumbleUpon</a>.  Basically it allows you to say what types of things you are interested in and then lets you "Stumble Upon" new websites related to your interests.<br /><br />The best one I've found so far is <a href="http://svt.se/hogafflahage/hogafflaHage_site/Kor/hestekor.swf">four hourses singing</a>.  It reminds me of a better version of <a href="http://www.hamsterdance.com/">hamsterdance</a>.  Quite funny.  I'm not sure what that says about my interests though.
