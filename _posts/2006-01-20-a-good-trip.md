title: A good trip
---
I just got back to Banda Aceh.  My trip went really well.  I had good meetings everywhere I went, even better than expected.  I'm excited about some upcoming projects that I helped set up.  There is a good chance that I will be off to East Timor in February.  It will be cool to visit the worlds youngest country.  <br /><br />I also drove my new bike back from Medan.  I almost tripled the total miles on the bike in that one trip.  It runs beautifully though and looks great.  I'm really excited about having it around.
