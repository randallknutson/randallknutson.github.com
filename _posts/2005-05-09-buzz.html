Last night when I was riding home from watching "Kingdom of Heaven," something fell out of a tree and hit me in the chest.  It felt like a small stick so I didn't think anything of it.  After a few minutes though It started feeling funny and I thought it might have gotten stuck on my shirt so I reached over to grab it and throw it off when it stung me.  I flung it off as fast as I could and regained control of my bike.  I thought I had lost it but then I felt it land on my right arm.  I have no idea how since I was traveling about 50 MPH at the time.  I carefully hurled it off my arm and gunned it out of there.  I now have a sore pinky and a mildly interesting story to tell.  I don't know if it beats the time I hit a bat while I was riding.
