Rainy season is in full swing here in Indonesia.  It has rained almost every day for the last couple of weeks and probably will for the next three months.  <br /><br />In Bandung there are two seasons, the rainy and the dry.  There the rainy season lasted for 9 months and it rained almost every day at 3:00 for an hour or so. <br /><br />Here in Meulaboh there are also two seasons but they are rainy and hot.  The hot season lasts for 9 months and then the rainy season is 3 months.  Really there are four seasons but three are just the direction the wind blows and it is hot.  Right now it is nice because it cools off when it rains and isn't always ridiculously hot.  It still gets muggy in the afternoon though.
