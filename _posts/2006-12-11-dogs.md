One is 13 and the other is 4.  I was worried that I wouldn't make it home before the older one got too old but he's still happy and energetic.  I took this picture a few days after I got home.  The big white dog is the younger one and the smaller basset is the older one.<br /><br />Well, the day after this picture was taken, the younger dog got an eye infection.  I don't just mean a little eye infection, it looked like his eye was about to explode.  I finally took him to the vet on Wednesday and the vet was very concerned and said stuff that sounded really serious.  I got some medicine that might help and treated him for a couple of days.  His eye got better but he got weaker and weaker.  He also lost control of his bladder which didn't make my parents very happy.  When I brought him back to the vet two days later, I practically had to carry him out to the car.  The vet was even more worried that he had some kind of anemia which could be caused by leukemia, cancer or some auto-immune disease.  We decided to leave him at the vet clinic so they could try and treat him as best they could but we opted not to spend thousands of dollars on blood transfusions and the like since they probably wouldn't help him anyways.<br /><br />We've now waited all weekend and have only heard that he is resting but not if he is getting better at all.  We'll head up there today and hopefully we will know whether he will live or not.<br /><br />The odd thing is that I was expecting this from the older dog, not the younger one.  The older one is still as happy as can be, except he misses his brother.
