title: Sold my bike again
---
So I just arrived back in Banda Aceh and decided to sell my bike.  I'll only be in Banda Aceh for two days this month and then a little more than a month after that before I go home for good.  I had a friend who was very interested in buying it and we agreed on a good price so I sold it to him today.  I'm sad to see it go but I didn't need it anymore.  <br /><br />I'll be in Banda Aceh for today and tomorrow to get a handle on the situation (seeing as I'm still running the base) and to show the VP around the project site.  I'll be heading back to Jogjakarta on Monday.
