title: Good News, Bad News (which is actually good news too!)
---
Skype has decided to give away calling to the US and Canada for the rest of the year.  This is awesome news for me since I use SkypeOut quite regularly and will continue to do so till the end of the year.  The bad news is that it is only free if you are calling from within the US and I am in Indonesia.  So why is this still good news? A few months ago I switched to a satellite internet system that has an IP Address in the US instead of Indonesia so as far as Skype knows, I'm in the US and can get free calling to the US!
