I went out to my old school, Faith Academy, this morning.  It was really neat to see it again.  I attended 2nd to 5th grade between 1987 to 1991 there.  Of course, all of my classmates are no longer there.  Or so I though.  I was wandering around with my dad visiting different places I remember and ran into my old little league baseball coach.  Turns out his son, Peter Beck, is visiting right now.  I stopped by and saw him and hopefully will be able to hang out with him more while I'm here.<br /><br />Anyways, Faith is in the process of building a couple new really big buildings and a swimming pool.  Its exciting to see my old school doing so well.  I also got hooked up with the alumni people and will be giving them my life story.  Hopefully I can add to my autobiography again sometime.  My mom keeps telling me that some of what I have written isn't entirely accurate.  Oh well, its what I remember.
