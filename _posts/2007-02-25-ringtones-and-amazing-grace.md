title: Ringtones and Amazing Grace
---
When I got my new phone in the US, I wanted a ringtone that was funny and not too annoying if it went off in a place it wasn't supposed to.  I settled on a cow mooing and I really like it.  I had an ongoing joke with Ryanna when we are at the movies that if my phone did go off, people would just think the mooing was some cows in the movies. <br /><br />So we went to see Amazing Grace today which was a phenomenal movie, one of the best I have seen in a really long time. In the middle of it, I heard my phone go off.  Then I realized that my phone wasn't vibrating.  My next thought was that someone else had downloaded the same sound off the internet and put it on their phone and what an incredible coincidence that was.  Then I realized that there were some cows in the background of the movie that were mooing.
