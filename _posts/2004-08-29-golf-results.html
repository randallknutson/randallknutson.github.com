The golf game was a blast.  We had several newcomers out there (including me).  The winner was Chevy (AKA Tiger Woods) with a 45.  Josh came in second with a 53 and I came in third with a 55.  Not too bad for the third time I played.  We all had a lot of fun and we even had a sponsor that gave us golf visors that had "FAOMOBGT" printed on them.  Can't wait for the next one.
