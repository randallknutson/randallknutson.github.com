Apparently a bill ratifying the peace agreement in Aceh is supposed to go into affect today.  The Acehnese aren't very happy that some parts of the peace agreement were left out of the bill so now there is a general strike at least for this morning.  At our work site there is nobody except our staff there working.  The Canadians are all ready to go but now have nothing to do.  Hopefully things will pick up in the morning after the strike is over.
