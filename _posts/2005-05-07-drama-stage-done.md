title: Drama Stage done
---
We had our last work day for drama today.  We finished painting and getting all the stuff for the stage.  There are now just a few things left to do to finish it like a doornob here, curtains there.  For the most part it is done and looks great. One more week and we will be done.  Practice went well yesterday.  The first act is looking really good but the second act is still pretty rough.  We tried the firework for an explosion yesterday and it sounded really good.  It is loud.
