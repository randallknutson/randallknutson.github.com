Okay, a couple of quick notes on what is happening.  Today is the start of the High School Youth Group retreat which is always a great time for the students.  This year everyone in our high school signed up except one which is a huge change from previous years.  Many of the students going are not christian yet so be praying for them.

<br />I took yesterday off of work and traveled to Jakarta to see a friend who I haven't seen in a long time.  We had a great time together catching up.  She had been traveling to Sri Lanka and Aceh to help with the relief work and was stopping by in Jakara.

<br />Tomorrow is a national holiday for Idul Adha.  It is the day when they celebrate when Moses sacreficed the ram in exchange for his son (they think it was ishmael instead of isaac even though it it ambiguous in the koran).  The most remarkable part for me is the millions of goats lined up along all the roads for the weeks leading up to it.  They sacrifice all the goats and some cows on Idul Adha and give the meat to the poor.
