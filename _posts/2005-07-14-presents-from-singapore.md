Some friends just came back from Singapore on a visa run (having to leave the country to renew their visa) and they brought me a bunch of goodies.  I got a Subway Sandwich (first I've had in three years!) and a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie, also from Subway.  They also brought Apple Jacks and Golden Grahams cerial!  I enjoyed a bowl this morning.  So good!
