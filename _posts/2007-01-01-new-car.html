So I picked up a new car a couple days ago. It is a silver 2003 Honda Accord with less than 40,000 miles on it. I really like the car since it is a standard and drives really nice. I looked at the VW Jetta but decided not to get it for several reasons. I'd don't have to drive around my parents van anymore.<br /><br />Happy New Year Everyone!
