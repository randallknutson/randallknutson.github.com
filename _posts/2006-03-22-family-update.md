My older sister, Niki, has a few new waterfalls behind her house in Kauai because of the dam bursting.  She's fine though and my parents will be visiting her after tax season.<br /><br />Congrats to my brother, Paul.  He has finally passed the last section of the CPA exam.  That means he is now a <a href="http://www.aicpa.org/">Certified Public Accountant</a>, like our dad.  That means he can also now sign his name, Paul Knutson CPA.  <br /><br />My other brother, Ben, just bought a new car since he crashed his other one.  Its really <a href="http://67.15.66.175/south_pics/1G8AY14P74Z200380/DCP_7252.JPG">cool looking</a>.  Its a Saturn Ion or something like that.<br /><br />My little sister, Valerie, has a new boyfriend, Jacob.  Everyone I've talked to says he's really cool and that she really likes him.  Gotta love LeTourneau for matchmaking, at least if you are a girl.
