title: Back in Indonesia
---
I arrived back in Indonesia last night and flew up to BA first thing this morning.  I got off the plane and was immediately working.  I've had a really sore throat for the last couple of days but didn't think a whole lot of it.  I was walking around inspecting houses this morning and then came home.  Now I'm really starting to come down with something.  I don't know if it is related to the sore throat, what I ate for lunch or just sunburn/heat exhaustion.  Whatever, I'm not feeling real good.<br /><br />Because of this I'm sorry I don't have the energy to post more pictures and stories about my trip.  I promise I will as soon as I have the strength to do so.
