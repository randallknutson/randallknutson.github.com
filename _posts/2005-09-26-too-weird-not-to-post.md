title: Too weird not to post
---
I don't usually rehash news stories that don't relate to me but this one is too weird.  Apparently in the path of Hurricane Katrina was an Army training base for dolphins.  The Observer claims that the dolphins were trained to use toxic dart guns to kill terrorists attacking military vessels.  Some of them may have escaped during the Hurricane.  While the Observer claims that the dolphins could be carying the guns but I am highly skeptical that they are left on the dolphins all the time, much less during a hurricane.  How odd would that be though to have killer dolphins roaming the gulf?<br /><br />http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1577753,00.html
