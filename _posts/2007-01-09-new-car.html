Yesterday I loaned my car to my dad since his was in the shop (someone hit him going down the alley).  I needed the van to take the dog for a walk in the woods and he and mom wanted to check out Ben's new apartment.   On the way up there there was a wreck so the traffic was stop and go for an hour.  During that time a lady ran into the back of my car.  Luckily she wasn't going very fast but there was still a little damage to the bumper.  So much for my new car.
