I flew up to Banda Aceh in an Airvan today and I was the only one on the flight besides the pilot.  After we had taken off, he started doing some paperwork and I asked if the plane had an auto pilot.  He said, "Yeah, you!"  So I started flying without any instructions.  After a few minutes I had it pretty figured out.  It wasn't too hard except since it was a pretty small plane with no rudder trim, while we were climbing it pulled left a little.  I flew about half the flight before he took back over.  No, I didn't take off or land.  I'm pretty sure that is still beyond me.
