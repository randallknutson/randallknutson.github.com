title: Philippines Here I Come
---
I'm ready to announce the first of the exciting plans I promised to tell you about.  My parents are going to be in the Philippines the second half of February and the beginning of March so I am going to go and join them.  It will be the first time since I was 11 that I have been in the Philippines.  I can't wait to see how things that I remember are different now.  We will be going to the wedding of our house helper that we have stayed in contact with.  Awesome!
