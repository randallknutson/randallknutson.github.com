title: (Last) Postcard from Kuala Lumpur
---
This is my fourth and final time in Kuala Lumpur for this trip.  I've been staying at a tiny little but very nice guesthouse named the Red Palm that I would highly recommend if you are in Kuala Lumpur.<br /><br />The good news is that all of our visas are finished here in KL.  We now have China, Kyrgyz, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia in our passports.  The only one left is Tajikistan and we need to go to Uzbekistan for that one since there isn't a consolate around here anywhere.  <br /><br />Stephen and I have got train tickets tonight for an overnight train to Butterworth near the island of Penang and will probably spend the morning sightseeing in that area.  Then we have overnight tickets for Butterworth to Bangkok.<br /><br />We also tentatively have added Angkor Wat to the itinerary which adds Cambodia to the list of countries.
