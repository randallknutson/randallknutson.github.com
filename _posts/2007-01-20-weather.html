It snowed here in Texas a few days ago.   Hard to believe, huh?  The weather was actually below freezing for a few days and there was lots of ice on the roads which caused a lot of accidents.  Of course this is an excuse for me to put a picture of my car on the internet.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/car-717174.png"><img style="cursor:pointer;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/car-714153.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>
