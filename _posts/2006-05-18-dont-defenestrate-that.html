Did you know that <a href="http://www.answers.com/defenestration">defenestrate</a> means to throw something or someone out a window? Me either until it showed up as the word of the day.  <br /><br />Can you imagine yelling at someone, "Don't defenestrate that!"  I think you would just get some confused looks.  <br /><br />Apparently usually it refers to people being thrown out a window.  For example, in 2 Kings 9:30-33 Queen Jezebel is defenestrated.<br /><br />If ever a word deserved to be the word of the century, I think this should be it, merely on account of coolness and near complete uselessness.
