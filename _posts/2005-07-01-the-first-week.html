Well, officially the first week is not over but I wanted to fill you in on what I've been doing so far.  As soon as I arrived I got busy meeting people and running around getting settled.  I've met about a million people and been invited out to eat for almost every meal.  I'm just now starting to slow down a bit and have time to think about what is going to happen.  Right now I've got at least two good opportunities for jobs up here but they are both waiting a couple of weeks for approval and funding.  Both of them are very good fits for me and the people are very interested in hiring me.  I'll let you know more when I know.<br /><br />I don't know if I've written about it but  I've got my bike mostly fixed up.  When I got here it was in pretty rough shape from the long trip.  Both rims were bent pretty bad from the billions of pot holes I hit going too fast.  The brakes were completely gone.  The engine needed an oil change and tune up really bad and the entire bike was caked several layers deeep in mud.  I've since washed it up, replaced the brakes and gotten a full service tune up and it is running pretty well.  The only problem left is that the wheels are still pretty bent. You don't really notice unless above 60 Kmph though so it isn't so bad around town.  I'm going to try and get it fixed this afternoon.<br /><br />I'll write more about my trip when I get my notes out and get to a computer again.
