It is very nice to be in Penang.  It is the small things that make the difference.  The fact that I can shave in a sink and not in a bucket, a real sit down toilet, a shower with hot water (I haven't used the hot yet since I so used to the cold), fajitas at restaurants and starbucks with free internet!  How much better could life get?<br /><br />I did get some work done here.  I ran into someone that I needed to meet with anyways and we met for the whole morning and most of the afternoon on work stuff.
