Seems like lightning follows me wherever I go.  Our internet got hit by lightning last night.  Fried the netmodem for the satellite and the wireless bridge to the office.  Will be a few days till it is fixed.  Luckily this time it isn't my responsibility to fix it.  I'm using the free UN internet for now but it is a 15 minute drive from the office and will be closing down in a week.
