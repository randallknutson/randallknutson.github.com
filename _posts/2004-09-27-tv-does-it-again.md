title: TV does it again
---
I've gotten hooked on another TV show.  This one is called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290978/">"The Office"</a>.  It is about a disfunctional paper supply company and their problematic boss.  They are facing a downsizing and merger with another branch.  The show is hilarious in that the boss thinks he knows everything and that everyone likes him.  In reality he drives everyone nuts.  The style is almost like a documentary or reality show.  Well done BBC.
<br />
<br />On a 24 note, we are through with the first 8 episodes of season 3.
