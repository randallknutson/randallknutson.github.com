My plane ticket has been issued and I am confirmed on the whole thing.  I will be flying Cathay Pacific which is in the top 3 airlines in the world.  I will be arriving in Dallas at 5:20 AM on Sunday the 19th of December. Plenty of time for church!

<br />Rainy season has definitely been going recently.  We had about 3 weeks straight of rain but the last three days have been rain free.  On the positive side, the number of mosquitoes have definitely gone down in the last month.  Not like before when there were hundreds in our house.

<br />The oldest and longest employed person at our school retired this week.  Pak Ukar is 88 and has worked at the year for about 40 years as best as anyone can recall.  He was a security guard for the whole time.  The next longest is the librarian who has worked here for about 13 years.  Pak Ukar has lived on this hill for his whole life and remembers the Japanese invasion in World War 2 and lived through both Sukarno and Suharto regimes.  He is quite a character and never fails to salute you as you pass.  While he doesn't have much physical deterrence for thieves, his reputation in the community has probably prevented our school from more trouble. Terima Kasih Pak Ukar!
