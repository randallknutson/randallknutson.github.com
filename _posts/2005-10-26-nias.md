I went to Nias yesterday for a livelihood meeting there and it went really well.  We talked about what people were planning on doing and what they had to offer in terms of expertise.  One thing that came about from me being there was that the UNDP is going to fly a couple rubber experts in from Medan to do an assessment of the rubber trees on teh island.  I only had one meal on the island and had some great seafood.  I was looking forward to some pork (Nias is a Christian island as opposed to Aceh) but didn't get around to having any.  I flew back this morning and spent some time configuring a server at the airport for the internet.  Back to work now though.
