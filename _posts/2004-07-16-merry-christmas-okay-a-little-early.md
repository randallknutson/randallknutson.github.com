It is good to think ahead though, especially when you are traveling internationally.  I am now booked on a flight to Dallas in December.  My family will be having a reunion this Christmas in Dallas.  We haven't really been together since my brother's wedding 3 years ago.  It will be good to spend some time together again.  My last two Christmasses were spent alone on a beach.  The first was in Bali 100 miles from the nearest person I knew and the last one was in Phi Phi Island in Thailand with 3 friends. Hopefully I'll have pictures from that trip up soon.  Anyways... It will be good to see the family for christmas again.
