Our last performance of Rumors was last night.  It went incredibly well.  Many in the audience said it was the funniest play BAIS has ever done.  Lots of people came back to see it the second night.  We had one major glitch last night right at the beginning.  Our phone on stage wouldn't ring because a phone on the third floor got left off the hook.  I had to run up and hang it up.  The actors covered it well though.<br /><br />I'm going to miss directing dramas.  In spite of all the work I really do enjoy it a lot.  On opening night when everyone is sitting there enjoying all the hard work you  have done, it is very fun.  We have the cast party in a few minutes.  I'm taking everyone out to Longhorn, which is a nice restaurant with ribs and steaks.  We made enough money to be able to afford it.
