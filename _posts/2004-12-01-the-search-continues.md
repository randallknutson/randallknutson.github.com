It has been a busy week this last week.  With Agus gone it has seemed like everything that can break has broken.  It now seems like I've fixed most of it but I'm getting pretty exhausted.  I have interviewed several people about filling in for Agus and it looks like we have some good choices.  Hopefully in the next week or so we can make a decision.  For now, I'm going to go fix something.
