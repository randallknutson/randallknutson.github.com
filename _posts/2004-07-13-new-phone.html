My old phone got stolen on a small ferry so I bought a new one.  It is a <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/T630/">Sony Ericsson T630</a>.  Pretty nice phone.  It has WAP internet (still don't have it working).  It also has bluetooth.  I bought a little USB bluetooth connector for my laptop but I have yet to get it working together.  All these cool bells and whistles have tons of potential but they are harder than heck to get working.  I'll keep putzing and see what happens.

<br />Update:  I have Outlook Sync working now
