So I needed to come back from Bagabag to Manila last night and bus seemed like the best way to do it.  Here is what happened.<br /><br />I started out walking around 8:00pm and realized that probably wasn't the smartest idea since I saw almost no cars for about 15 minutes and the road was really dark.  I realized that I was a single foreigner walking along a dark and lonely road in the middle of the Philippines and didn't really have any way to contact anyone.  I was the perfect target for anyone looking to mug someone or worse.  I was starting to get a little nervous when I said, "God, I could really use some help!"  A Trike came right up almost immediately and drove me to the bus station.  As I paid the trike, A <br />bus pulled up and I got right and was on my way.  The bus was comfortable and not crowded so I was able to sleep most of the way.  About 7 hours later I arrived in Manila.  A quick taxi from the bus station and I arrived at the Manila Guest house around 3:00.<br /><br />Part of the reason that I did this was to see what it would be like to travel across a country in the middle of the night when I don't speak the language and am not too sure how to do it.  This was a trial for an upcoming trip that I still haven't told you about but have hinted at and will hopefully tell you about soon.
