Many of you have asked for more information about what I am doing up here.  I would love to post tons about what I'm doing but Samaritan's Purse, like most organizations, is careful about what its employees say.  I'm going to try and share as much as I think I can.<br /><br />Right now I'm managing the Banda Aceh Shelter Program which consists of building houses for people who lost them in the tsunami.  We are currently building over 100 houses with many more on a waiting list to be built.  The houses are going up really quickly and it is fun to see more walls and roofs every time I go out there.  It is really starting to look like a village now.  Lots of families are moving into the already finished houses and are very appreciative of the gift to them.  Its really neat to see.<br /><br />Here are some photos I took yesterday.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Library - 2919-762551.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Library - 2919-760168.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />This is a finished house.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Library - 2921-726808.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Library - 2921-723366.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />I love this photo because you can see the 40+ foot fishing boat that was washed up by the tsunami still there a year later.  It is a couple of miles from the ocean.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Library - 2922-754725.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Library - 2922-752810.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />This is a house that has the walls finished but no roof, plaster or paint.
