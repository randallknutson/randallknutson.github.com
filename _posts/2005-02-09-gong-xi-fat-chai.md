Happy Chinese New Year of the Rooster everyone.  Today is the lunar new year for the chinese and they celebrate in Indonesia by all the singles go around to married people and say "Gong Xi Fat Chai" and then are given money.  Apparently they get quite a bit.  Tomorrow is Islamic New Year and Friday is Korean.
