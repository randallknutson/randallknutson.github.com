Several of my favorite software has finally hit 1.0 status.  The first is GAIM which is an Instant Message software that allows you to use all the major and a lot of minor IM networks in one.  This means you can use AIM, MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, Jabber, Napster, IRC and many more IM in one program.  Check it out at <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/win32/index.php">Gaim's Homepage</a>.
<br />
<br />Second, Mozilla Firefox, the best browser on the web has hit 1.0PR status.  This is a preview release of the 1.0 browser which means it is finished and in final testing mode before the official 1.0 release.  I've been using it for several days and can say it is rock solid and has more features than you can wave a stick at. See my earlier post as to why mozilla is such a great browser.
