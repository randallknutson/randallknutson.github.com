title: What's Next
---
Some of you may be wondering what's next.  I could have hit the pavement and gone looking for a job or just done an Office Space.  Instead a couple of guys from work and I are starting a company to do something very similar to what Professional Edge did.  It is exciting yet a little nerve wracking to go out on your own and see if you can survive. <br /><br />We are just starting to form plans but hopefully we can formulate a plan to make enough money to support our families and maybe even thrive a little.  So far it is looking good and we should be off the ground in a couple weeks or so.<br /><br />Right now, as a pet project I'm creating a home spun CRM solution that runs on ASP.NET.  The idea came to help my future sister in law and her husband with their home business.  It is morphing into something more than I thought it would be but that is probably a good thing.  Hopefully it will turn out good.  When I have a good working copy, I'll try and post a demo to the web.  It will take a while though.  It's pretty complicated.
