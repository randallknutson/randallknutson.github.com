My roommate Matt recently got back from the US along with all the other teachers and unlike all the other teachers, he brought me an oleh-oleh (souvenier).  I now am the proud owner of a rubber ducky for my desk.  Why would this be a good souvenier?  It goes back to a book I read in one of my college classes that recommends rubber ducking when you are stuck on a problem.  Rubber ducking is explaining your problem to a rubber duck (the author had one, you don't have to use it).  In the process of explaining to it, you organize your thoughts and figure out the answer.  The rubber duck doesn't even have to answer to help you figure out the problem!  For those of you who are interested, the book is <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=020161622X&amp;TXT=Y&amp;itm=1">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> which is full of other words of wisdom such as "Don't think outside the box, define the box."
