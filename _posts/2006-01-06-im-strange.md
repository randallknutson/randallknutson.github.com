I drink cold water<br />4. I ride my motorcycle by myself long distances<br />5. I ride my motorcycle without a "wind vest"<br />6. I swim in the ocean<br />7. I like to run<br />8. I like to run in the afternoon<br />9. I don't scratch a coin down my back when I get a cold<br />10. I don't eat rice at every meal
