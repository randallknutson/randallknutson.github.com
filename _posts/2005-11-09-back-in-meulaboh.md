title: Back in Meulaboh
---
I spent the last week during Ramadhan up in Banda Aceh and just got back yesterday to Meulaboh.  I rode my bike up the inland road through the east coast.  It is a MUCH better road than the west coast.  It only took me 6 hours as opposed to over 10 on the other.  No mud and broken roads either.  <br /><br />Now I'm back finishing up the three remaining projects, agriculture, fish ponds and boat building.  They all should be done by the end of the month.  I'm not sure yet what I will be doing after that.  We'll see...
