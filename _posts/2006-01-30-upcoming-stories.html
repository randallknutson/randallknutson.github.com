I'm really sorry for not posting recently.  I've had a bit of a lull in interesting things I can post at the moment.  I could tell you that I just had another trip to Medan (which I did) and that I am still building houses (which I am) but not else is really happening besides that.  <br /><br />There are three really big stories coming up but I don't want to spoil the suprise on what they are yet so I'll let you know as soon as I can.  One of them I promised a long time ago but I will definitely be able to tell you friday.  The others are relatively new developments and I'll let you know when I can.<br /><br />I know I'm being vague but I'm trying to build up mystery for all these events.  Bare with me.  It will be worth it.
