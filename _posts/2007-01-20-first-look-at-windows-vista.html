I went in to work today and in the mail was our new version of Windows Vista for development and trial.  I was installing VMWare so I fired up Vista in it to try it out. <br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that it is a lot shinier.   Notice I didn't say prettier, I said shinier.  Everything looks like they put a lot of time into trying to make it look better but it turns out looking like a bad winamp skin.  I mean, black for a the taskbar color?  And whats up with the goofy shaped start button.<br /><br />Overall I wasn't impressed.  I bet that part of my impression was due to the fact that I've been using Mac OS X for the last year and a half.  I didn't really see anything great about it except that some stuff was simplified and streamlined a little.  Of course that just means I have to relearn a bunch of stuff.  Most of the annoying things about the windows paradigm are still there.  Oh, and it was really slow.  Probably because it was running in a virtual machine but the host machine was no slouch. <br /><br />So, should you upgrade to Vista?  I haven't used it much but from everything I've read and seen so far, don't bother yet.  In fact, don't bother until you get a new computer.  And when you get a new computer, get a mac.  I promise you won't regret it.
