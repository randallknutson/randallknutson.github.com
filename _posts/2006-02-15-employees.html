One of our field supervisors has been sick the last few days.  He was checked out by a nurse friend yesterday and went to the hospital today and confirmed that he has appendicitis.  Hopefully we can get him surgery in the next couple of days.<br /><br />On another note, a couple of other field supervisors have taken to wearing white gloves on their left hands supposedly due to sweating.  As long as they don't get extensive plastic surgery to their face and bleach their skin I'm okay with it.
