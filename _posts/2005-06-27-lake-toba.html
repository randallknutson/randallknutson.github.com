Sorry for the long wait between updates.  I was in places where there was no internet access for a long time. <br /><br />I was in Lake Toba which is a beautiful lake with an island in the middle.  There are almost no tourists there even though it is a great place.  It has fallen out of favor for some reason.  I would highly recommend anyone to go there.  Very amazing.  I climbed the central mountain on the island and went around and explored the area for a while.  Then I left for Meulaboh.
