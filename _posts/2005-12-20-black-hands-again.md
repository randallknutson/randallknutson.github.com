title: Black Hands Again
---
Yesterday I had to go apply for my third visa extension on my current visa.  The first time it is 2 months with the possibility of 4 one months extensions after that.  For the third extension though you have to go and get finger printed.  This basically is you go down and they put both your hands in black oily ink and then smear them across several pieces of paper and then each finger one at a time.  This leaves you with very black, very messy hands afterwards.  What do they do with the papers you may ask?  Put them in a file and never look at them again.  Ah, the fun of living in Indonesia.  I have to leave within two months though because my visa will run out.  I'll probably head to Penang again for a couple days.
