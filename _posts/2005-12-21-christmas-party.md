Tonight we had our SP Banda Aceh Christmas Party.  After we ate we sang songs.  That was pretty interesting being the only non-indonesian there.  They all knew the main parts of a song like Jingle Bells but after that they just kind of hummed so it was just me singing until the chorus came along again and then everyone would join in again.  Either that or it was in Indonesian and I didn't know it.  Good times.  Good times.
