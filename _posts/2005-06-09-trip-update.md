title: Trip Update
---
I've decided to postpone my trip for a couple of days until I'm ready.  I won't be leaving this saturday but instead will be aiming more for tuesday.  I'm also going to be trying to take a ferry part of the way although that might be a little tough to do.  <br /><br />On a side note, I'm going to be having a friend, Arvin, updating this website for me if I am not able to so you should always be able to find out what is going on.<br /><br />Tuesday also happens to be my birthday.
