I leave in about 8 more hours.  I should probably get some sleep.  Here is my itinerary.
<br />
<br />Dec 18 at  2:50 PM to 8:35 PM Jakarta to Hong Kong
<br />Dec 18 at 11:35 PM to 7:55 PM Hong Kong to Los Angeles
<br />Dec 19 at 12:35 AM to 5:19 AM Los Angeles to Dallas
<br />
<br />Notice on the second leg of the trip I arrive before I depart.  That is where I fly backwards in time! Pretty cool.  I think Einstein was on to something.
<br />
<br />I don't know how often I will be posting between now and Jan 10th so don't expect much.
