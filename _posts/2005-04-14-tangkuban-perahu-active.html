Things are really exciting for geologists in Indonesia right now.  Not only have there been 9.1 and a 8.7 earthquakes and many 6.X earthquakes but volcanoes are going nuts as well.  In West Sumatra where the big earthquakes were, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4440019.stm">Talang Volcano</a> has started erupting and 26,000 people were evacuated.  Even more fun, <a href="http://www.indonesia-relief.org/mod.php?mod=publisher&amp;op=viewarticle&amp;cid=24&amp;artid=663">Anak Krakatau and Tangkuban Perahu</a> are both acting up.  Why is this fun?  Tangkuban Perahu is the volcano 30 minutes from my house that we always visit.  I might have to go check it out this weekend.  I'm sure I can bribe my way to the top.<br /><br />Mom and Dad, that's the one you visited while you were here.<br /><br />Update: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,153420,00.html">Fox News</a> has another good story on it.
