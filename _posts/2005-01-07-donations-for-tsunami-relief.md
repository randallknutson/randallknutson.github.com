title: Donations for Tsunami relief
---
Some people have asked me about donations for the Tsunami.  I would recommend <a href="http://www.hearttoheart.org/">Heart to Heart International</a>.  I have a friend with them and they are sending trained medical staff and supplies to the affected areas.  Information on how to give is on their website.
