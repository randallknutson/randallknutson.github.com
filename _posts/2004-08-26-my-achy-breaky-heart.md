title: My achy breaky heart
---
I've been having some trouble with my heart the last couple of days.  I'm not exactly sure what it is but I wasn't feeling very good.  I went to the doctor today and had an ECG and a blood test.  They didn't find anything out that is definitely wrong but there were a few small anomolies.  I will be going for a complete physical early in September and I think I'm okay until then.  I just hope it isn't anything serious.  Still on for golf this weekend.  Also, we started 24 season 2 last night.  oh boy...
