Tonight was a near full moom and around 8PM there was a brilliant yellow moon on the eastern sky.  We were trying to figure out why this is and figured it is either polution or Mount Merapi erupting.  Mount Merapi is a couple hundred miles to the East of Bandung and the ash is supposed to be coloring the sky quite beautifully in Yogyakarta.  There is a very high chance that the volcano will be erupting full scale very quickly.  Oh, also there was a 6.1 earthquake in Banda Aceh again yesterday.  Gotta love Indonesia.  It keeps you on your tows.  Interestingly, for every major earthquake in Aceh and Nias, I've been out of the province when it happened.
