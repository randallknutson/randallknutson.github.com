This week our school will be a little different.  We are doing something called Week Without Walls.  It is basically a school wide outreach program.  We are doing different activities in the community to help out.  Originally I was on a Habitat for Humanity team but that fell through so now I am helping lead a team to a drug rehab clinic.  Should be interesting.
