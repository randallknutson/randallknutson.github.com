title: Feeling better
---
It has been a week since my last wisdom teeth were removed and I'm starting to feel back to normal.  I've had some nasty problems in my nasal cavities and my throat, not to mention that my teeth hurt.  I've been taking tons of different medications and I hope I can stop them soon.<br /><br />On a side note, the school now has a gym so I don't have to drive downtown to work out anymore.
