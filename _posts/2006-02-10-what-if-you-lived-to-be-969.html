Every once in a while I have really random thoughts.  One that I've had off and on for a long time is, what would it be like to live to be 969 years old?  Can you imagine what type of world we would live in if everyone lived that long?  <br /><br />First of all, the stuff we buy would be pretty crappy.  Most cars barely last longer than ten years.  That means you would have to buy at least 96 cars in your lifetime.  People would probably make them a little better though.  The Yellow Cab Car company used to make a car that was made to go 1,000,000 miles and last for 50 years.  If I lived to be that old, I would want a car like that.  <br /><br />Computers are another thing.  Most laptops last 2-3 years (unless you buy Macs!)  Thats a lot of laptops.  Same with most things.  They aren't designed to last very long.  This works great for us people with short lives but if we lived nearly 1000 years, I think it would drive me nuts always having to replace worn out stuff.  I'd want a car that would last 300 years at least and a computer that would last at least 50.<br /><br />Its pretty crazy to think about what life would be like if it were that long.  What do you think would be weird?  There's got to be a good movie or book plot here somewhere.
