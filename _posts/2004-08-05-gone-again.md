Most of the teachers at my school got back last night and we are going on a trip to Pangandaran today.  I'll be back on Monday.  The Sea Tour people had a party last night and watched the video from the trip, all 4 hours of it.  It was fun to relive funny parts of the trip even if the movie was a little long.  I hope to edit it up and post it on the website.
