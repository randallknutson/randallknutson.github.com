I installed one of my old favorites last night and played till about 2 in the morning.  I'm disappointed that I can't get the Mac version to "launch" the arcologies.  SC 2000 is still my favorite of all the SimCity games just because of the arcologies.  Lots of fun.  I was still able to take a city from start to almost 9 million in just a few hours.
