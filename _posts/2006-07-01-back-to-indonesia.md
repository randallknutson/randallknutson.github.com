title: Back to Indonesia
---
I've had a really awesome time in the US for the last couple of weeks.  I've been really busy so I'm sorry I haven't been posting to my blog.  I'm now on my way back and should be arriving back in Indonesia tomorrow morning.  I spent my whole time in Dallas with family and friends.  I'd like to appologize to all the friends that I wanted to see but didn't have time and to all the friends who I only briefly saw and wanted to spend more time with.  I'll try and catch up with all of you better next time.  <br /><br />I've always joked that I wanted a water buffalo for my birthday.  Well this year I got one.  Because everbody's got a water buffalo, right?  At least a small wooden one, but it counts!  I could buy a real one in Indonesia but it would be about $500 and I don't know what I would do with it.  That is a little expensive just to be able to say that I have one.  So where is your water buffalo?
