My appologies for not posting more often.  I've been a little busy working and getting ready for the wedding.  There is good news though!  I will probably have more time to blog now.  Professional Edge, the company that I have been working for is folding.  That means I have lots of free time I wasn't expecting and not a lot of money that I was.<br /><br />If you know of anyone who needs a highly motivated, honest and hard working employee, let me know.
