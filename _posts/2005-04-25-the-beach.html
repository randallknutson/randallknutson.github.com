We had a lot of fun at the beach this weekend.  One of the highlights for me was at night.  I wasn't getting much sleep in my room.  All I was getting was eaten by mosquitos and hot.  I decided to try and sleep out on the beach.  I took my towel and slept right near the high tide line.  It was an amazing night of sleep since the water crashes tremendously there.  When I say tremendously I mean tremendously.  Every twenty seconds or so there is a boom that shakes the ground.  This is because of the high slope of the beach and the size of the waves.  I dreampt of earthquakes all night because the sand was shaking under the force of the waves.  It was cool.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed riding my bike all the way there and back.
