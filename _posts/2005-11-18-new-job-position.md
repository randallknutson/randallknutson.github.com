My current job of Livelihood Program Manager for Samaritan's Purse has slowed down since most of the projects are coming to a close.  Sometime next week I'll be heading up to Banda Aceh to take over the Shelters project and become base manager.  As Shelter Manager I'll be overseeing the building of 500 houses around Banda Aceh.  As Base Manager I'll be going to all the meetings as SP and managing the house and different operations.  I'll still be Livelihood Manager although that will be mostly just writing a couple proposals around Indonesia.  The plan moving forward is to work on the Banda Aceh Shelter program until it completes sometime early to mid next year and then maybe focus on some livelihood again as more funds become available.  I'm really excited about this opportunity.
