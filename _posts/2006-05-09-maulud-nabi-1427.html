Today was Maulud Nabi day which I believe is "The Prophet's" birthday.  Basically this year I was invited to a bunch of lunches all served at the same time.  It is kind of like a Christmas potluck but with foods you probably would never recognize.  <br /><br />One of the foods they cooked was beef kari Acehnese style like we had at the innauguration.  It was as awesome as ever and I got the recipe from them.<br /><br />Beef (chunked into 1 inch cubes) 8-10 kg<br />Bananas (2 stalks) or Young Jackfruit 3 also chunked<br />Lemon grass 6 stalks<br />White Shallots 3.5 Kg sliced<br />Red Shallots 1 kg sliced<br />Ginger 200g sliced<br />Cilantro 200g<br />Dried Cilantro 50g<br />Dried Red Pepper 500g<br />Small Red Pepper 700g<br />Pepper 500g<br />Salt 500g<br />Dried Coconut filings 1 kg<br />Coconut milk 5 coconuts<br />Curry powder 500g<br />A couple of other things I don't know what they are but aren't terribly important<br /><br />Get a cooking wok 1/2 meter in diameter and build a fire underneath.  Add the seasonings and water and heat up.  Add meat for 20 minutes and then add vegetables.  Serve with rice.  Feeds 50-70.  I'll have to try it sometime when I'm back in the US.
