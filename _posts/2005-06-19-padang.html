I made it to Padang which was a 550 Km trip.  Took over 10 hours including one spill off the side of the road.  Not to worry though, I only have a small bruise on my leg, a fixed headlight and a slightly wobbly front wheel.  That will teach me not to try and read signs while I'm going around corners.  Padang wasn't so great.  It was just an industrial city that smelled like dried dog food.  It is a portal to much better places including some great islands (which I might come back to some other time) and Bukit Tinggi, where I am now.
