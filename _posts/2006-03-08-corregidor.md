When I was at Faith Academy visiting my old elementary school, I ran into an old friend named Peter Beck.  We decided to go to Corregidor together.  For those of you who don't know, <a href="http://corregidorisland.com/index.html">Corregidor</a> was a major US Navy base during World War II and a sight of some major battles. <br /><br />Anyways, so we decided to get a cheap ride over and overnight it camping out on the beach.  That was the plan anyways.  When we went to buy tickets, the only operating boat was Sun Cruises and they didn't sell passages only.  You had to buy a tour package.  So we decided to do that and just eat the cost.  Well, we only bought a one day tour and just figured we could come back the next day.  When we asked, they told us that we would have to pay for a return ticket as well.  Grr!!!  But they had a special that had a hotel room and a return ticket the next day for less than the price of the unconfirmed return tickets.  Needless to say we decided to do that.  We ended up in an airconditioned hotel room with hot showers.  Thats better than my house in Aceh and I was expecting to be camping on the beach!<br /><br />Okay, so we got to the island and started to take the shuttle tour around the island that we had paid for but about 10 minutes into the 5 hour tour we decided not to continue.  We got off and hiked around the island off the tourist paths for several hours and saw lots of really cool stuff.  I'll explain more in the pictures.  By the end of the day we were completely exhausted, dirty and ready for a nice shower and bed.  Boy did it feel good.  we saw so much the first day that there wasn't a whole lot to see the second day so we just hung out by the beach and relaxed.  To put it more accurately, we were too sore to do anything.<br /><br />Without further ado, here are some pictures:<br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Corregidor1-721902.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:hand;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Corregidor1-719798.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>This is a picture of Peter and I waiting for the ferry to Corregidor.  Interestingly enough, we dressed with very similar clothes and the same colors.  Fahion faux pax?  Nah, we're guys.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Corregidor2-753550.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:hand;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Corregidor2-751097.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>This is a picture of the main part of the base.  You can see how the structure is crumbling.  This one is in a well kept area.  We hiked through the jungle and found many more old buildings like this with lots of vines and trees all over the place.  Plus when you find them in the woods, you can explore the buildings and don't have to worry about them telling you not to.  They like to warn you about falling debris.  Oddly enough a softball sized chunk of concrete fell off once and hit me on the leg.    Luckily it only broke the flashlight I was carrying and just hurt a little bit.  Good thing it didn't hit me in the head.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Corregidor3-741697.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:hand;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Corregidor3-738898.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>This picture is me coming out the opening of a shaft in the ground.  It looks really cool but didn't actually lead anywhere.  We found much more interesting ones but none that looked as cool from the outside.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Corregidor5-752317.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:hand;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Corregidor5-750106.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>This is me in a tunnel like many we climbed in.  There were lots of these small Japanese styled caves around the island.  One of them we climbed in and it had a degree of decent around 60 degrees.  It was made of dirt too.  Climbing down was basically an effort not to slide down with a torrent of dirt.  We weren't even sure if we could get out.  Turned out we could though.  There was another tunnel that opened up onlo a cliff face.  Really cool.  You just come to the edge and look down 200 feet to water.  These caves are why we were so dirty after the day.  I still have dirt all inside my shoes and cell phone.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Corregidor4-705913.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:hand;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Corregidor4-799496.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>There were tons of battery installations on the island.  This is one of the larger ones we found.  The plaque was partially destroyed so all we could read was ***** battery.  This confirms that it was a battery but not which one.  As far as we could tell on the map, it is Cheney battery.  Of course with a gun that big, you have to ride it.
