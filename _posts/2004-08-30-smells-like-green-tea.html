Our computer lab has been notoriously smelly.  It is one of the few air conditioned rooms on campus (the library is the other).  We have tried to figure out why this is and can only guess that it is the 20 sweaty kids that have just come in from PE.  For 2 years I have just put up with it but this year I decided to get some air freshener.  I bought the good stuff that you plug in and prompty installed them upside down.  All 3 months of scent spilled out in 1 hour.  It took us 3 days of airing out before we could close the doors again.  Today I bought replacement cartridges and installed them right side up.  Now the office is a pleasant green tea smell and the lab is a sunny citrus smell.  BTW, green tea makes a great bathroom scent as well.  Much better than rose.  Ask my roomates on that one.
