I'm in Medan now and I'll be traveling back to Banda Aceh this afternoon with a team of 27 people from Canada.  They are here for two week work trip to our project.  When I agreed to have them come I didn't realize how big the logistics for 27 people is.  I'm looking forward to picking them up in a few minutes and helping them make an impact in the villages we have been working in.  They will be doing construction and some community health training.  Of course I have hardly been in Banda Aceh for over 6 weeks but I have a good staff that hopefully has prepared for everything.  We'll see!
