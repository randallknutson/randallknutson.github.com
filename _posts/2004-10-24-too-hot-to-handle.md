title: Too hot to handle
---
This afternoon a few of us went out to see Farenheight 9/11.  I was pretty upset by what I saw.  Michael Moore made some good points like the connection between the Bushes and the bin Ladens and the recruiting policies of the marines but overall I was pretty upset after watching this movie.  I came into the movie with no respect for Moore and left with even less.
<br />
<br />I have to admit that after half way through the movie I started getting bored and tuned out quite a bit.  The amount of misinformation and factual distortions were overwhelming and my brain shut down.  Moore would find a fact and state it and then draw 4 or 5 conjectures from it and state it as fact.  Some of my friends left the movie feeling sad and embarassed about being proud to be American.  If that was Michael Moore's plan for making the movie than congratulations to him.  BTW, I already have voted but it wouldn't have change my vote anyways.  I hope Moore runs for president so I can not vote for him.
