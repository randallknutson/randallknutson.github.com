I've talked with lots of people over the years about passwords.  Usually the first thing I say is, "the most common passwords are: god, sex, love, secret and password." Invariably, one out of every four people I say that to gets a look on their face like I can read minds.  Clearly I've guessed theirs.  In fact, many people choose very poor passwords.  I've got my own technique for creating passwords but <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/robert_hensing/archive/2004/07/28/199610.aspx">a Microsoft employee</a> is recommending that you not use passwords at all with Windows.  His basic premise is that even if you choose a random order of letters and numbers, it can still be cracked easily if it is less than 14 characters long.  To counter this he says to use passphrases instead of passwords.  For example, "Four score and seven years ago." would be a good passphrase.  Windows allows up to 127 characters for a password/passphrase.  Why not start using more?  <br /><br />Unfortunately many online sites don't let you use more than 8-10 which requires some more obfuscation.  Here is one way that I create short passwords.  First, pick someone you like or a favorite word.  I'll use "hermaphrodite".  Now, replace all of the vowels with numbers (i=1, a=2, e=3, o=0, u=4).  We now have "h3rm2phr0d1t3".  Now for all of the consonants, move tha characters to the left (or right) one character on the keyboard.  So instead of typing an "h", type a "g".  Our password would now be "g3en2oge0s1r3".  Which is very hard to guess but easy to create if we know that the root word is "hermaphrodite".  Throw in a few capital letters and it gets increasingly hard to crack.<br /><br />One final note, Many online sites ask for an e-mail address and a password.  If you forget your password, they will e-mail it to you.  I HIGHLY recommend creating a unique password for your e-mail and not using it for any of the sites you use that e-mail address for.  If I signed up for a site and gave it my e-mail of randall@hotmail.com (not my real e-mail address) and set the same password as my e-mail, all the admin of the site has to do is go to hotmail and enter the same password you gave him!  I always keep my e-mail password different than the password I use for other things.<br /><br />For your pleasure, here are some more common passwords: admin, 12345, 54321, 111, , 0000000, 11111111, 88888888, pass, passwd, abcd, 123qwe, server, computer, 123asd, ihavenopass, godblessyou, jesus, enable, xp, 007, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, foobar, a, aaa, abc, test, temp, win, pc, asdf, qwer, yxcv, zxcv, home, xxx, owner, login, pwd, pass, mypc, mypass, pw, (blank).<br /><br />Is your password on the list?  If so, you might want to change it.
