Looking at Google News articles about Bush meeting with Olmert revealed a good amount of spin.  Look at these headlines from the first page.  Keep in mind that these are all from major news sources.<br /><br />President Bush Holds a Joint Press Conference with Prime Minister ...<br />Bush praises Israeli PM's plan about West Bank<br />Bush welcomes West Bank plan<br />US urges Olmert to talk to Palestinians<br />Bush gives cautious welcome to Olmert's plan<br />Bush fails to back Israeli plan for borders<br /><br />What the heck is going on?  These headlines seem to run the whole gammut of possibilities.  It seems that Bush and Olmert are either best friends, bitter enemies or somewhere in between.<br /><br />My trust in the media is cut in half after reading this which puts it hovering right about 0%
