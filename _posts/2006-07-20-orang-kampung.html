Orang Kampung literally means "village person" (not to be confused with The Village People) but could be translated as "redneck" as well.  So in honor of Jeff Foxworthy...<br /><br />You know you're an Orang Kampung if:<br /><br />1. You can fit more than 5 people on a 100cc motorcycle<br />2. You think toilet paper only belongs on a dinner table<br />3. You've had your picture taken with a westerner you don't know<br />4. You think a Britney Spears song makes a great ring tone<br />5. You sleep with a band-aid over your belly button to "keep the wind out"<br />6. You have wondered about the purpose of a trash can<br />7. You have tried to use a western toilet but your feet kept slipping off the seat<br />8. Your television and satellite dish cost more than your house<br />9. You own cows, chickens and goats but aren't sure where any of them are<br />10. You think there are two food groups: chicken with rice and fish with rice
