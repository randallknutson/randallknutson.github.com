This post may seem a little strange in light of my previous post.  Some of the staff here have been planning a trip to Jakarta to get a physical.  We are still planning on going tomorrow in spite of the bomb.  Right now though, the street that our hotel is on is closed down due to the bomb so we are very much hoping it will reopen before we get there.  Be praying for the situation.
