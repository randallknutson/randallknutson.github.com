title: Airport hotspot
---
I'm waiting in the airport for my flight back up to Banda Aceh.  I flew in for a meeting on Wednesday and stayed thursday and friday since I had to work through the thanksgiving holiday.  I've had hot showers and a sink to shave in for the first time in a long time.  If you have never gone without such niceties, you really can't fully appreciate that last statement.  It makes it all the harder to be going back to cold bucket showers.  Anyways, I pulled out my powerbook laptop to write up a job description for the new Shelter Coordinator who is starting tomorrow when up popped a message that there is a hotspot.  Yay!  That means I'm probably not going to get any work done on the ground now since I can browse the internet.  Gotta love hotspots.
