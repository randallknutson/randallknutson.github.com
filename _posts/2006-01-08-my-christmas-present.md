title: My Christmas Present
---
Since I was in Indonesia this year for Christmas, I wasn't able to exchange gifts with my family.  They put together some money to get me a present though.  A friend is in Singapore picking up my present and should get it to me in a week.  It is a <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/etrexVistac/">Garmin extrex Vista C</a> GPS receiver.  Thats hint number three for my upcoming plans.  I hope to send out a newsletter soon explaining my plans for the second half of this year.  Stay tuned.
