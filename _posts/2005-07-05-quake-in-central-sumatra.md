There was an earthquake last night as some of you may know.  It was located pretty far away.  I thought I felt something but wasn't sure.  Come to find out this morning that there was a 6.8 last night.  Nothing around here though.<br /><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/07/04/indonesia.quake.ap/index.html"><br />CNN story on earthquake</a>
