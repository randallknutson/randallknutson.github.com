title: Gladiator of faith!
---
Tomorrow I will be leading the Middle School and High School chapel.  We have been working through the Armor of God.  Tomorrows chapel will be the shield of faith.  The last time I spoke in chapel (almost exactly two years ago) the topic was just faith, now on a completely different topic, the "shield of faith."  I'm going to start off with the battle scene from Gladiator with all the flaming arrows (of the evil one!)  Then talk about what faith is not, what faith is, what the shield of faith is and then how to live with the shield of faith.  Of course I am up here working late at night trying to finish my presentation.
