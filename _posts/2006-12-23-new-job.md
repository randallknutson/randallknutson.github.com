I've only been back for about three and a half weeks but I've already got a job.  I've agreed to work for Professional EDGE, a computer consulting firm that I interned at while I was in college.  They are very happy to have me back and I'm excited to be working for them again.  I'll be doing a mishmash of different jobs that can be defined as "Computer Consulting" and are in the general area of anything a business might want in a custom computer program.  This will probably involve a lot of programming and other support.  As with my previous jobs, I can't post specifics about what I am doing but I'll keep you up to date as much as I can.
