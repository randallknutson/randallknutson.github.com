In two days I will get on the plane for America!  I've got plenty to do before then but I got my christmas shopping done today.  This last week or two has been pretty hectic.  Between making all the purchases before the end of the year and settling contract disputes caused by Agus and his departure it has been very exhausting but has been a learning experience.  I am now a lot less trusting when it comes to business and money and I have learned how easy it is to rip people off.  The new guy, Ray, is working out very well.  He is smart, knows computers and is a hard worker.  I am very grateful for his help these last couple weeks.

<br />I have to proctor an exam today and one tomorrow, meet with a company, go out and pick up some equipment and then I'm done for the holiday!  Friday all the guys are going to play a round of golf.  Saturday morning early I will leave.  Can't wait!
