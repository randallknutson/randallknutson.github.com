Okay, I needed to buy some tioletries yesterday and so I went to a local store. My supply that I brought with me from the US last summer has finally run out. Of course they didn't have any deodorant.  It is actually very difficult to get deodorant in this country.  I'm not entirely sure why, the people could really benifit from using it.  I finally went to a larger store and went to the cosmetics section.  They had a couple tiny sticks of deodorant in the back cabinet along with the really expensive stuff like perfume.  They won't even give it to you until you have paid at the cash register.  I can't figure it out. Why is deodorant such a luxury item?
