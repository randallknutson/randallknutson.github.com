Well, not right away but I'm pretty sure I will eventually.  We had our checkup in Jakarta and the results were pretty good.  The doctor said there are no problems with my heart.  I disagreed since it definitely doesn't feel normal.  I'll accept that there is nothing dangerous but there is definitely something wrong.  I'm guessing arrhythmia.  Not a life threatening thing nor something they can do anything about so they probably just didn't bother mentioning it.  I'm going to do some independant research and see if there is anything I can do/need to do about it.  The doctors did mention that my HDL is slightly low so I need to excercise more and there are crystals in my urine so I need to drink more water.  That was about it for their recommendations but there are still some tests outstanding.  I'll get the final report in about 2 weeks.
