title: I have no money!
---
Wohoo!  I officially have no money.  Why would that be cool?  Because as of today I'm no longer in debt.  I've been using my bank's online tool to agrigate all my different investment, credit card and loan accounts and today the bottom line is in the black.  Thats pretty cool considering just over three years ago I graduated with a pretty large debt.  Its all up hill from here!
