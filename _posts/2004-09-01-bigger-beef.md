Our new server just arrived today and I've finished setting it up and moving all the files over.  It actually got here a couple of weeks ago but after running for an hour the power supply fried.  We sent it back to be fixed and now it is.  I'm just finishing up getting everything moved.  It has been a lot more work than I thought but it is done.  Tomorrow now everyone will have problems but c'est la vie right?  It will take a few days to iron out all the wrinkles.  Until then I just won't sleep.  We have a new server though, Yay!
