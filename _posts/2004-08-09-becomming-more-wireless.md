title: Becomming more wireless
---
I just got my new laptop to go with my new phone.  It is a <a href="www.dell.com">Dell</a> Inspirion 1150 with internal wireless.  Anywhere on campus now I can access the network.  Combined with my new phone with bluetooth and GPRS I can also access the internet when I'm not at school.  Pretty cool but expensive.
