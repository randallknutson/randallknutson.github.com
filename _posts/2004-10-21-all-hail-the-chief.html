Today is Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's first day as elected President of Indonesia.  He is the first directly elected president.  His inaugeration yesterday had one very unique aspect to it.  The former president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, didn't attend.  This was a big snub.
<br />
<br />She has reason to snub him though.  He was her security cabinet member and while on a assignment in another country she took all his power away.  He responded in an open letter that basically said, let me do my job or fire me.  She refused and he quit.  He then went to trounce her in the polls.
<br />
<br />Good luck SBY!
