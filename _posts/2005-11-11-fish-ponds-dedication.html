Today is the dedication ceremony for the fish ponds project in Gampok Lhok.  We have been rebuilding 30 fish ponds for the village that were destroyed by the Tsunami.  We are going to have a big ceremony today with a bunch of government officials and all the local villagers.  It has been a great project to do and the people we have worked with have been most excellent.<br /><br />Here is a photo of the fish ponds taken from our helecopter:<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Fishingponds-777532.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Fishingponds-774019.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />It is really cool to go out there now because when we started the area was a swampy marsh with 6 foot growth of weeds and such everywhere.  Now you can see the 30 ponds and the guard shack at the bottom of the photo.  The pond in the middle on the bottom row is a cement lined pond that is for catfish.  The rest are for 3 other types of fish.
