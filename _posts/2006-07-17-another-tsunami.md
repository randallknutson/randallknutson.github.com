title: Another Tsunami
---
This afternoon (middle of the night in the US), there was another earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.  First of all, rest assured that I'm okay and didn't even know it happened till I read the news.  It actually occurred near where I used to live in Bandung.  The villages that were hit are Pangandaran and Cipatujah.  I used to go to Pangandaran for vacation at the beach.  Both of these villages are much smaller than similar areas hit by the tsunami in Aceh, not to mention that the tsunami is much smaller.<br /><br />So far it sounds like the earthquake was a 7.2 and the tsunami was around two meters high (six feet).  It was enough to shake the area a bit and damage some coastal houses.  Early reports were that about 30 people were missing and now they say that at least 6 are dead.  Rumor has it that the tsunami flooded the village up to 1 kilometer inland.  I'll post more if anything important happens.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, it is on the same fault a few hundred miles east of the Jogja earthquake.
