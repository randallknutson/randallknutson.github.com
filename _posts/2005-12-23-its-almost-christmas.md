title: Its almost Christmas!
---
After much strenious effort, I have successfully made Christmas sneak up on me.  Its hard to believe in only two days it will be Christmas.  Not only that but tomorrow I will be flying back to my former life in Bandung, using my old bike (two bikes ago) and living in my old house (several houses ago).  It will be cool to see my old friends again and I need a break from my job.  It has been quite stressful the last few weeks but still lots of fun.  Can't wait to see Bandung and all my friends again.
