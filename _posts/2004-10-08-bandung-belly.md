title: Bandung Belly
---
I've been pretty sick the last few days with a case of Bandung Belly.  Everyone who comes here or lives here has experienced it at one time or another.  Basically you get really sick with diarhea and vomiting and get really tired.  I'm still really tired and am trying to rehydrate myself after being dehydrated last night.  Indonesians call it masuk angin which means you "catch a wind."  They are really paranoid about this and wear wind vests while riding motorcycles and taping their bellybuttons while they sleep (seriously). I guess it isn't a whole lot different than "catching a cold" in the western world.

<br />Think masuk angin is crazy but catching a cold is not?  Read <a href="http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/health-info/dis-cond/cold/coldfact.html">this website</a> or one of many others about whether or not cold and wet will actually cause a cold.
