Hasn't it been  nice having a cell phone and not getting telemarketing calls on it like your home phone?  Well things are about to change.  That's right.  In one weeks time, the list of cell phones will be made public and as a result telemarketers will be able to target your cell phone.  And the best part about it is that you will still be charged for the call!<br /><br />Luckily,  there is something you can do about it.  Go to <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov/">www.donotcall.gov</a> or call 888-382-1222 to register your cell phone or home phone for the national do not call registry.  This will stop telemarketers from calling your phone for five years.  Unfortunately it doesn't stop charities or pollsters but should put a dent on most of the marketers.<br /><br />UPDATE***<br />Turns out I jumped the gun.  The FTC still does not allow automated dialing to cell phones even if they open up the list of numbers.  Most marketing agencies don't call if they can't use automatic dialers.  Still, it would be wise to sign up all of your numbers to keep as many marketers out as possible.
