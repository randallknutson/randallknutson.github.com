For our Aceh trip, we have received just about all the stuff we are bringing.  This includes:<br /><br />700 school supply packs (pen, pencil, eraser, notebook, ruler)<br />315 Backpacks<br />315 School uniforms including socks, hats, head covers, shirts, shorts and skirts<br />100 pairs of school shoes<br /><br />It is amazing how many boxes all this stuff is.  The fun part will be getting it all there.
