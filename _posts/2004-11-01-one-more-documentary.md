I watched one more documentary last night which is called "The Art of War."  It is an interview with Robert S. McNamara who was Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War.   This is what I would expect from an ordinary documentary.  It wasn't boring or angering, nor funny and exciting like the other two I have watched recently.  There were some points that really stuck out though.  It was made before 2000 and the Iraq War.  He used a lot of the same phrases for Vietnam such as "winning their hearts and minds."  There were some pretty apparent differences though.  I was not alive during the Vietnam war so I don't know a lot about it but from what I could gather during this documentary, the war was being fought by two sides trying to be free that each though the other was trying to enslave.  Another thing that struck me was that when Kennedy died, LBJ really messed things up.  McNamara even says that had Kennedy lived it probably would have turned out different.  Makes me scared for America if Kerry gets elected.  He is saying the same things that the challenger in 1964 was saying.  Things could get ugly if we have a President who is against the war and is not trying to win.

<br />Overall a good documentary with some really good lessons.  Not an exciting piece though.  There is a lot of truth in it since it comes straight from the man responsible instead of conjectures from an outsider.
