I just discovered that there is a new 20th Anniversary edition of the hugely popular Hitchhikers Guide to the Galexy Game.  I played it a few years ago in the old text based format.  The new one still is inherently text based but has cool graphics to help as well.  For those of you who have never heard of it, it is based on the strangely intelligent book, radio show, TV series and movie by Douglas Adams, who also designed the game.  Playing it reminds me of my early childhood games like "Swiss Family Robinson"  Check it out.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/game.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/game.shtml</a><br /><br />Oh, I also found the Swiss Family Robinson Game<br /><br /><a href="http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?id=1467">http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?id=1467</a>
