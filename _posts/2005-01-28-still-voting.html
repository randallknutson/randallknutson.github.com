I got an "Official Absentee Balloting Material" in the mail today from the US.
<br />
<br />My first thought was, hmm, I've already voted and the election is over.
<br />My second thought was, that was awfully late in coming.
<br />My third thought upon opening it was, oh, its a special election for a bond for the Duncanville School District.
<br />
<br />The good news is that I voted.  The bad news is that I really don't know what the issues are so I probably shouldn't have.  Oh well.  Better to have...  my clever whiticisms fail me finally.
