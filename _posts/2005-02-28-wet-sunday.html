Yesterday I went out after church with some friends to a local restaurant.  We went by Ankot (public transportation) and had a great meal together.  Of course just as we get up to leave the rain starts pouring.  I didn't have an umbrella and didn't ride my bike so I had to run about half a mile to my house.  i had sandles on and jeans so I rolled them off and took off my sandles and just ran.  I was still soaking wet by the time I got home.  So much fun.<br /><br />Later that night I went and saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/">Constantine</a>.  I found it enjoyable but the theology was all over the place.  It was written from a very heavily catholic tradition with some occult thrown in.  I was sad that they minimalized the involvement of God in our lives and increased the power of the evil ones. It seems a little silly to me to think that we have to save ourselves against these awesome forces.  I know I sure couldn't.  Other than that is was fun and somewhat original.  <br /><br />I've been having some good discussions recently about religiously themed movies such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286106/">Signs</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315327/">Bruce Almighty</a>.  Signs I found interesting philosophically but boring as a movie.  Bruce Almighty I found very enjoyable and it dealt very well with some difficult religious questions like love, free will and power.  Bruce Almighty I would highly recommend to anyone.  Constantine I would recommend to fans of action and thriller movies but don't read too much into it.  Signs I wouldn't really recommend unless you like M. Night Shmhamamalanannnnn.
