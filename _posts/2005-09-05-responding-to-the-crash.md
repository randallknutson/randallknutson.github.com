title: Responding to the crash
---
The plane crash happened only a few miles from our office so our director decided to sent a quick response team to the scene.  I was in the office so I was put on the team.  When we arrived there were still fires burning and they were still pulling people out of the wreckage.  It started pouring down rain and we handed out water to whoever needed it.  I got absolutely soaked in no time and after a while things started calming down so we returned to the office to dry out and regroup.  We are planning on offering our assistance in any way possible to the authorities.  The airport is open again so I will be flying out to Meulaboh in a few minutes again.<br /><br />The governor and former governor were on the plane.  Luckily the vice-governor was not because he cancelled yesterday.<br /><br /><a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;q=mandala&amp;btnG=Search+News"><br />Google News</a><br /><a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/detaillatestnews.asp?fileid=20050905113624&amp;irec=0">Jakarta Post Story</a><br /><br />Update: The CNN link was wrong so I replaced it with the Google News link
