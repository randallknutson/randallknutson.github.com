I arrived in Singapore yesterday afternoon and immediately met up with my friends.  We've been hanging out for the last day.  It is good to have people I know to hang out with and go see stuff with.  I've been to Singapore before so it isn't much different than last time.  People are more organize, get in lines and stuff is more expensive here.  That is about it.  Oh, and the public transportation is REALLY easy to use.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/SingaporeJPG-735652.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:hand;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/SingaporeJPG-733972.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Last night we all went on the night safari at the Singapore Zoo.  We took the tram ride around for the first 45 minutes and then walked the trails for a couple of hours.  I have to say it was really interesting to see all the animals at night.  They get really active.  Usually at zoos they are just sitting around or sleeping whereas at the night safari, they were all up and moving.  The Night Safari is highly recommended if you ever visit Singapore.<br /><br />We went shopping today just to see around.  Lots of good food too!  Pretty expensive.  After sunset we went out to the beach for some reason.  I guess my friends like the beach after dark.  It was nice though and we had some Singapore Slings.  They were... a little overated if they are rated at all.  I guess you have to have one when you come here though.<br /><br />Tomorrow I'm off to Malaka to get some ferry tickets for later on in the trip. Good news too!  We got our Letter of Invitation for Uzbekistan so we can now get the visa.  I was really worried that wasn't going to happen.  All the visas are now coming together.
