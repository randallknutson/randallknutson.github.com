title: New Motorcycle!
---
I bought a new motorcycle!  That is clue number two to my plans after my contract is up.  I'll fill you in more later.<br /><br />My new bike is a Honda Phantom which is a really popular bike in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.  Again it is only a 200cc bike but that is really big here.  It is a cruiser style as opposed to a crotch rocket like my other bikes.  That makes it more comfortable for long ride (hint hint).  Here is a picture of a Phantom.  Not my bike but someone elses.  Mine is very much similar.  I got it used from the SP Country Director who bought it new and has only ridden it about 500 km.  <br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/honda-phantom-717206.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/honda-phantom-714102.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
