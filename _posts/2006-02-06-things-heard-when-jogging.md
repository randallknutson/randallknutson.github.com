title: Things heard when jogging
---
Being an American jogging through villages in Aceh, I tend to draw a lot of attention.  I regularly get comments which usually consist of "Hello Mister" or "How are you!"  The last few days I've had some rather startling comments.  They are "You are very handsome," "Will you marry me?" and "I love you!" <br /><br />Normally something like this would start to go to my head.  Every time it starts to though I just remind myself that these comments were all said by 12 year old boys.<br /><br />This is My Rather Random Ramblings after all.
