This year for spring break, which is March 19-27, I will be helping to lead a team of students and staff up to Banda Aceh to help with relief work.  The plans are still in the early stages and so more details aren't coming yet.  Everyone is really excited though because we all want to do something to help.  I'll let you know when I know more.
