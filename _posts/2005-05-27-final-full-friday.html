Only two weeks to go till the end of the school year.  This is the last full friday as the next two are half days.  I've been working on editing the video together from the Rumors play.  I had three cameras record it from three different angles and I'm editing it together.  It really is coming out good.  The only problem is they weren't the best of cameras and didn't have white balancing so everyone looks like they have hepatitus.  Much better than the last recording though.
