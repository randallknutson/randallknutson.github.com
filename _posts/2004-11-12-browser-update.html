There is a great article up on ArsTechnica about Malware for beginners.  Basically it is software that does stuff to your computer that you don't want.  If your computer is running slow or is doing things you don't want it to, check out this site.  The most common ways to get it is to download P2P software such as Kazaa, Napster, iMesh or to use Internet Explorer (The big blue "E" on your desktop) or to install free stuff like smiley packs or screensavers.

<br />In other news, Mozilla Firefox has released version 1.0.  If you want to keep from getting malware and/or want a better internet experience, download it now.  Almost everyone I have ever shown Firefox has never used Internet Explorer again.  Give it a try.  You won't regret it.
