I'm headed out to Sabang which is on Weh Island just north of Banda Aceh.  I decided to take a vacation for a few days so I am going to head up there.  I'm not sure what the internet is like there so I may be out of contact for a few days.  Hopefully I can get some good diving and snorkeling in while I'm there.  As usual I will be bringing my video camera to record it for use later on, maybe.
