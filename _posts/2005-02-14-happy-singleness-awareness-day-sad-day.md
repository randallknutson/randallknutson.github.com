title: Happy Singleness Awareness Day (SAD Day)
---
I'm still single so I can be bitter about it.  <br /><br />Here are some does and don'ts for singles on this SAD day.<br />Does:<br />1. Go for a walk in nature.<br />2. Buff up at the gym.<br />3. Stay home and eat whatever you want.<br />4. Watch a horror flick.<br />5. Wander around your neighborhood (or campus) with a waterballoon launcher and plenty of waterballoons.<br /><br />Don'ts:<br />1. Go to the movie theater.<br />2. Go out to dinner.  <br />3. Go to any mall with hearts of flowers showing.<br />4. Send a card to someone (Could be your last SAD day if you do).<br />5. Tag along with a friend on his/her date.<br /><br />Happy SAD day everyone.
