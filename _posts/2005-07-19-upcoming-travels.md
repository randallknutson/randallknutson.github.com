I've got to leave the country at the end of this month.  I have to go to Bandung first for a week to get an exit permit.  It is totally Indonesia that I have to get an exit permit and that it takes a week to get it.  Oh, and if I'm waiting on them to finish it when my visa runs out, I have to pay the penalty for overstaying my visa.  Then I will be going to Singapore for a few days to get a new visa.  It will be my first time to visit Singapore which is incredible seeing that I have lived in Indonesia for 3 years and have yet to get there.  Can't wait.  They have a Taco Bell, Subway Sandwiches and many more western restaurants.  All I have here is a KFC and they only have chicken and rice. I'm leaving Banda Aceh on the 24th, leaving Bandung on the 31st and arriving back in Banda Aceh on the 5th of August.
