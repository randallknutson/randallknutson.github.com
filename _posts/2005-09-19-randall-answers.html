I only got two questions, so that is all I'm going to answer.<br /><br />What were you doing 4 years ago today? (Well, today in your time zone--it is still yesterday here:-)<br />By Thainamu <br /><br />Randall - Fours years ago on September 11th, I was in college and just woke up to begin the day.  I flipped on the news as I do every morning and the were saying the second tower had just been hit.  I remember being very angry for quite a few days.<br /><br /><br />Have you maintained regular bowel movements ??<br />lol<br /><br />By Scott<br /><br />Randall - Living in Indonesia this is actually a huge issue.  Sanitation is not very good here and people are not very cleanly.  Almost all Indonesians don't use toilet paper.  I'll leave it to your imagination what goes on there.  What this means is that the amount of dysentary, giardia and other bowel problems are quite common.  I've heard that 60-80% of Indonesians have worms and almost that many have some form of bowel problems.  Slang for #1 and #2 here is "little water" and "big water".  That gives you some idea of how bad it is.<br /><br />In response to the question, I do have problems from time to time.  For the last few months I've had suprisingly few problems although in the last couple days I'm thinking I need to find some antibiotics or something again because I am definitely not regular.  Glad you asked.
