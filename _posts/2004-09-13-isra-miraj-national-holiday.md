title: Isra Miraj National Holiday
---
Today is the Isra Miraj Holiday. Isra and Miraj are events where the Prophet Muhammad was taken by the Angel Gabriel for a night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem, and from the rock now located in the Dome of the Rock, to heaven. This is not a religious holiday in the conventional way as there are not any celebrations or festivities associated with it, however, it is a time for reflection and prayer and some choose to fast during the day.  I played golf in the morning, got my lesson plans done for the week and will be going out to dinner this evening.  I like holidays.  We have next monday off as well, more on that later.  BTW, we didn't have last monday off for Memorial Day.
