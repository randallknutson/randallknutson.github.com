I got to drive my new bike today since I just arrived in Medan.  I've got to say that I absolutely LOVE my new bike.  It has lots more power than the other bikes I've been driving, it corners really well, it has a wide comfortable seat for long distances and when I stop at lights everyone looks at it.  I'll be riding it back to Banda Aceh on Wednesday.
