title: Its a small world
---
I was hanging out in the hostel the other night after a day walking around Kuala Lumpur when in the door walked an old student of mine!  He was one of the first class I taught and graduated the same time I left the school.  Pretty cool who you run into around the world.  It really is a small world after all. (dang, now I have that stupid song in my head)
