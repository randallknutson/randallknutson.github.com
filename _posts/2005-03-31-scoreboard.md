Two years ago Josh bought an electronic scoreboard for the new gym.  He bought it online from the US and shipped it to indonesia.  It was billed as being remotely controlled.  When we got it though, it was a dinky little remote and the scoreboard part couldn't be mounted in the gym as we wanted.  With a little hacking by Agus, my former assistant, we were able to get a setup close to what we wanted.  He actually removed the face and ran some cables up the wall to where we mounted the face.  Pretty cool actually.  The other bad thing is that it runs on 110V instead of 220V so the first time we used it, it was blown out.  Easily fixed though.  Two weeks ago when Josh plugged it in for a game, it didn't turn on.  I finally got my hands on it today fearing the worst.  After staring at it for a few minutes trying to decide what was wrong, I noticed a fuse.  Remembering that the fuse is always the first thing to test, I did so.  Yeah, it was blown.  So I soldered in a new one and we have a scoreboard again.  Wohoo!  Go Eagles!
