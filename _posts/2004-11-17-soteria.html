Just got back from the first day at Soteria Half-way house.  It went really well.  Basically we hung around all day and played games with the 60 people there.  I played a lot of Uno and then when I told them I was from Texas they all wanted to know about pistols and how easy it was to get them.  I told them my brother has an old WW II gun and they were really excited.  They also really enjoyed Uno and my pathetic attempts to explain how to play in Indonesian.  "Skip" was the hardest to explain.
<br />
<br />Later I played Yahzee (they never really understood this one) and some volleyball.  Quite a fun day.  The time really flew which was a blessing.
<br />
<br />At lunch though I went out to get some food since I had forgotten to bring anything (typical of me).  I asked a street vendor how much some egg rolls (something like that) were and he said 2 and a half.  I figured 2,500 RP (about 25 cents) so I asked for 5,000 RP worth since I wanted two.  He gave me twenty so I guess they were actually 250 RP each.  Oh well.  I was able to feed just about everyone with that much food.

<br />BTW: <a href="http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=4991">Soteria</a> is a Greek word that means: deliverance, preservation, safety, salvation
