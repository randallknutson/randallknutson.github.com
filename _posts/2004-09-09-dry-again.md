I may have been a little hasty in my announcement of the rainy season.  It hasn't actually rained since my post about it raining every day.  Of course since I am now posting that it hasn't been raining, will mean that it will rain all the time. (or now that I am predicting it will, maybe it won't).  Okay, my head is starting to hurt so I am going to stop writing.
