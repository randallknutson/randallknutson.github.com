title: Sick again
---
A recurring theme of living here in Indonesia seems to be having a stomach sickness.  I tend to get sick about once a month with diarhea, vomiting or both and I'm at it again.  I finally ate a little today at lunch for the first time since monday.  I've been trying to allow my body to "beat the bug" but after four days of not eating, having no energy and sleeping through my prep periods, I'm throwing in the towel.  I'm now on heavy doses of Flagyl to kill off Giardia.  We've lost a lot of the elementary kids to a similar sickness.  (By lost I mean they are home sick, not that they have died)  I can't wait till I am back in the US and don't have to worry about getting severe stomach sicknesses all the time.  On the positive side, there is no way to lose weight faster.  I've already dropped about 5 pounds!
