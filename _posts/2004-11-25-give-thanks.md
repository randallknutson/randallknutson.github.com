Today is Thanksgiving day so here are some things I am thankful for:
<br />
<br />1. For great friends and family who keep my life interesting
<br />2. For Indonesia being willing to host me as a foreigner
<br />3. For a great school and the opportunity to teach here
<br />4. For great colleages
<br />5. For being able to find a turkey and cranberry sauce in Indonesia
<br />6. For Reece's Peanut Butter Cups!
<br />7. Last but not least, for being saved by Jesus Christ
<br />
<br />Turkey dinner tonight!
