Over the three years I've lived here in Indonesia, I've seen just about everything being hauled around on the back of a 100cc motorcycle.  I've seen refrigerators, matresses, entire stores.  Yesterday finished off the list.  I was behind a guy carrying a kitchen sink.  That makes it official.  I've seen everything being carried around on a motorcycle, even the kitchen sink!<br /><br />I promise a job update by the end of next week.  I'm waiting on things to become official.
