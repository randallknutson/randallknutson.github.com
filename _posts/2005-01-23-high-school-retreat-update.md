title: High School Retreat Update
---
Our HS Retreat went really well.  The topic was "Being Real" and was led by Mark Richardson, the brother of the Athletics Director, Josh.  All of the high school, except one student, went which is huge for our school.  Many of the students were faced with questions about being real that they had never thought about and had some good questions of their own.  The whole weekend was a great success.  On a side note, I got sick and had to leave a little early but I'm all better now.
