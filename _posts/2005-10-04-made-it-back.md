title: Made it back
---
I finally made it back from my trip.  It wasn't really so bad but still an insteresting trip.  The road south of Banda Aceh was mostly under water.  That made it pretty interesting.  The mud wasn't as bad as last time but it was still pretty bad in places.  I didn't get stuck either.  This morning though my bag opened up as I was doing about 120 Km/hr and I didn't notice it.  I lost my toiletries bag and one of my sandals.  I now don't really have any shoes to wear.  I'll have to go buy some stuff to replace it all.  Luckily my cellphone, iPod, Computer, bible and medications were all safe.  I hope to head back up to Panga tomorrow or the next day.  Its good to have my bike back.  I've missed it.<br /><br />I visited a friend while I was up in Banda Aceh.  There is a new sandwhich shop there so we decided to go to it.  I had a turkey sandwhich for the first time in who knows how long.  Mmm.  Turkey.
