I realized coming over that I have 5 different airlines I'm flying.  So far my experience has been good except Tiger Airways.  NEVER FLY TIGER AIRWAYS.  They are a typical low cost airlines that likes to nickel and dime you to death but where they really excel is in overweight luggage.  They heavily enforce the one carry on per person and have a 15 Kg limit for check in luggage.  I had a bit more and don't mind paying for overweight most of the time because of it.  For Tiger I had 24 kg overweight (just over 50 pounds overweight for a total of 85 checked in) and they charged me more than my original ticket.  I was so upset that I filed a complaint.  I will NEVER fly them again.
