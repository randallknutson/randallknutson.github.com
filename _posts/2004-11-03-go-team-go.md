I followed the election last night although it was daytime for us here and I am very glad that Kerry conceded instead of dragging it out into a nasty court fight.  One thing that cracked me up is that every news channel had a different name for the election.  They ranged from "You Decide 2004" to "America Votes 2004" to "Decision 2004" to "America Decides 2004."  Even BBC had their own slogan.  Why not just call it the American election 2004?  Why do you have to give it a fancy name?

<br />It will be interesting to see what will happen in the next four years.  The American people have put a lot of power and trust in George W Bush and I hope he uses it wisely.
