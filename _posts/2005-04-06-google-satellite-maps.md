title: Google Satellite Maps

Okay, this is one of the coolest things I've seen in a while.  On <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> you can now switch to satellite view!  Just click the Satellite link in the upper right hand corner of the page. I searched for my parents house and then zoomed in.  I can see the tree out front, the pool and the roof.  I can almost make out the van parked in the driveway.  I can't see my sailboat though.  Must be obscured by the neighbors tree.
