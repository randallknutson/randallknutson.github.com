Just about everyone here in Indonesia smokes.  I've never smoked in my life, mostly because I don't like inhailing smoke.  When I'm around a campfire I like to sit <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=windward">windward</a> of the fire.  Of course Indonesians often want to offer me a cigarette and so in broken English they ask me, "Are you smoking?"  They mean of course, "Do you smoke?" but I always check above my head for any telltale tendrils before I answer.
