title: Took a bit longer than expected

So I planned on moving my blog a long time ago and did.  But the new server wasn't great and I never got the posting working again.  My life has gotten a little busy since then so I haven't bothered to fix it or post anything recently.<br /><br />We've got a new server at work so I've moved my website over to the new server and set it up correctly this time.   Hopefully I can start posting again.
