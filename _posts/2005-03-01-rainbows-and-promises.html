While listening to stories from people getting back from trips to Aceh, one of the most poignant is from Jay who talked to our group on Saturday. He was one of the first out there and is in charge of pointing all the groups that come from all over to the proper places to work. He is also the dad of one of the students going on our trip.<br /><br />Like all people who came back, he has said the devastation is beyond words. One of the things that really touched him though was while flying over the jungle one time, he saw rainbow after rainbow in the sky. He took lots of pictures and likes to include Genesis 9:12-16.<br /><blockquote><br />And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth." (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/">NLT</a>)</blockquote>
