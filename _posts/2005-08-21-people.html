Dealing with people is hard.  I love my new job but it has a lot to do with dealing with people.  That makes it hard.  Please be praying for me on Monday as there will be some major things happening in one of my projects.  Hopefully the outcome will be good and either way the project will be able to move forward in a way it has been struggling to.
