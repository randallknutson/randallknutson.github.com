title: Back in Bandung
---
It was great to get back to Bandung again.  I rented a car and driver to drive me from the airport in Jakarta to Bandung on the new toll road.  It has cut the drive time from   over four hours on a good day (seven on a bad) to around two hours when there is no traffic and not much longer when there is.  It was fun to whiz by all the old curves that used to take forever and give you nausea.  <br /><br />It seems that everything here has changed in the two months I was gone.  That may be because I'm now used to living in Banda Aceh.  Some other major road projects were finished that has really changed traffic a lot.  There is also a bit of a fuel shortage so lots of people aren't driving.  This has resulted in people driving faster and lots more people getting killed.<br /><br />Everything seems to look newer and cleaner than when I left.  I guess this is because of the state of Banda Aceh and Meulaboh after the tsunami and being used to that now.  It is good to be beach though and see all my friends.
