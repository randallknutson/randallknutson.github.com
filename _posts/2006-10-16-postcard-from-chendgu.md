UPDATE!!! Photos for the last three posts have been fixed.  Enjoy! <br /><br />Chengdu is more of a transition city for us and there isn't really a whole lot here we were excited about doing except for going to the Panda Research and Conservation Park.  This is where the majority of the captively bred pandas have been born in the world.  So this morning we hopped on a bus and headed over to check it out.<br /><br />This is a photo of Jing-Jing.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Chengdu1-752585.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Chengdu1-750104.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />She is the official Panda of the 2008 Beijing Olympics and if you think that is a little overboard, you haven't been to China recently.  Everything here is 2008 Beijing Olympics.  They are hyping it so much here it is ridiculous and it is still two years away.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Chengdu2-771891.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Chengdu2-769777.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Here is a photo of a couple of Pandas eating.  This seems to be one of the two primary activities of the Panda.  The other is sleeping.  They are incredibly slow and docile for bear-like animals.  It was a lot of fun to see them.  The center also has a really good video explaining all about Giant Pandas and the attempts they have made to breed the pandas.  They have been suprisingly successful the last 6 years or so.<br /><br />Also at the park was an added suprise for me.  The firefox!<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Chengdu3-790176.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Chengdu3-788176.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Technically called the Red Panda or Lesser Panda, a common nickname is the firefox.  Why is this so cool?  Those of you who have been reading my blog for a while know that I love the <a href="http://www.firefox.com">Firefox</a> browser.  The animals were cool to see in person and incredibly cute.  <br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Chengdu4-707770.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Chengdu4-705788.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Tomorrow morning we are boarding the long train to Urumqi.  We'll be on the train for several days and then after a short stop there, be heading by train to Kashgar.  Don't expect to hear much from me for a few days then.
