Having tried to sell some stuff online and having an e-mail address I have come across a fair amount of 419 scammers.  For those of you who don't know what they are, they are the people who offer to give you money for no reason or some stupid reason.  In the end they take all your money.  If you have some time, head on over to <a href="http://www.419eater.com/">419eater.com</a> and check out some of the ways that people mess with them.  Absolutely hilarious.
