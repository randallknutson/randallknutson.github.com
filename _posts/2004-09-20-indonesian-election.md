Today is a holiday for the Indonesian Presidential Election so we don't have to work.  Yay!  There are two people still running (it is a runoff).  Megawati Sukarnoputri, the incumbant behind in the poles and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY).  Most people I have talked to are going to vote for SBY because they think he can fix some of the major problems and is a strong leader.  Some say they will vote for Mega because they know her and know she doesn't do much so she can't be too evil.  Who am I voting for?  I can't.  I vote in November and will face a similarly difficult decision.  Of course I say that but I'm already pretty sure who I will vote for.  My friends and I are going up the the Volcano and Hot Springs today for some fun in the sun.  What a great Monday.
