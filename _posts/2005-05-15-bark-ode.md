<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=bar%20code">Bark Ode</a><br /><br />Oh how lovely can it be,<br />The stuff that wraps around a tree.<br />Rough and flaky to the ground,<br />Some is green and some is brown.<br /><br />It can be used as mulch for plants,<br />or as a hiding place for ants.<br />Protecting trees is what it does,<br />Like a mammal's furry fuzz.<br /><br />I will not write anymore on bark,<br />This whole thing was just a lark.<br />And so unless I've missed my mark,<br />There is not a single code in bark.
