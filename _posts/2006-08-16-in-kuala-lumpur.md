title: In Kuala Lumpur
---
I arrived in Kuala Lumpur without a lot of fanfare.  I've been trying to find my way around and get to know the city.  I found a nice little Hostel to stay in that isn't too expensive and is near lots of fun stuff.  <br /><br />I got extra pages put in my passport today at the US Embassy.  I love the US Embassy.  Its so nice to walk up, flash my US passport and walk by everyone else in line. I was through security, pages filled and out within 30 minutes.  Amazing.  Someone I don't think my experiences with the rest of the embassies are going to be as nice.<br /><br />Next I went to the Chinese Embassy which of course doesn't do consular services.  You have to go to the Bank of China for that.  So I went there and got the forms but didn't have all the information so I'll go back tomorrow to get it done.<br /><br />I also went looking for the Uzbek, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Embassies but apparently they have all moved since I got their addresses so now I need to get new addresses for them.  That pretty much sums up what I've been up to.  Hopefully I can get these done soon.
