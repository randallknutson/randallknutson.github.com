I bought a new video camera saturday.  It is the Panasonic NV-GS140 which is the Asian equivalent of the <a href="http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/vModelDetail?displayTab=O&amp;storeId=15001&amp;catalogId=13401&amp;itemId=88737&amp;catGroupId=25003&amp;modelNo=PV-GS150&amp;surfModel=PV-GS150&amp;cacheProgram=11002&amp;cachePartner=7000000000000005702">NV-GS150</a>. It has 3CCD technology which enables really good pictures and a 2.3 MegaPixel still camera.  It also has a remote control.  All this and it fits comfortably in your hand.  Very nice.  <br /><br />I hope to film a lot on my trip this summer and hopefully put together a cool video for all of you.
