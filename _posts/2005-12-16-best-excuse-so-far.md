title: Best Excuse So Far
---
One of the parts of my job is paying suppliers after construction materials are delivered.  We only pay by check since doing otherwise would require carrying huge amounts of cash around, something I don't want to have liability for.  Checks also leave trail that is much easier to follow.  <br /><br />It seems that every supplier hates getting checks and every time they want to get paid they have some reason why we should pay them in cash, but this time only.  Today the excuse in the morning was that the bank wouldn't be open in the afternoon to get the money because of friday prayers and they had to pay the drivers.  This afternoon was the best though.  The supplier came in complaining of having a fever and not feeling well.  She asked for cash as usual and when I politely explained, again, that we only deal in checks she pleaded explaining that she had a fever.  What does having a fever have to do with being paid by check or cash?  I'll see what excuses the following days will hold.
