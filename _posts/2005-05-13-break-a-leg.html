Sorry I haven't been posting much.  I've been really busy with finishing up the drama.  Opening night is in a couple of hours.  We had a really good dress rehearsal last night and hopefully tonight will be good too.  We are close to selling out which is impressive considering we have two nights at 200 seats per night.  Not bad for a small community.  I think everything is ready including all the video cameras to catch different angles.  <br /><br />One of the best parts about directing is that the night of I have relatively little responsability.  All I have to do is make sure nothing falls apart.  Everyone is trained in what they are supposed to do so I can just watch.  Way better than acting.  I'll let you know how it goes...
