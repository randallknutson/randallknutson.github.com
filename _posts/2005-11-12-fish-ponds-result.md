Well, it started out really beautifully as we waited for the ceremony to start.  Everything was perfect right up to the time it started to rain.  When I say rain, I mean torrential rain.  Everybody got soaked even though there were tents.  We still had the ceremony which was short and cool and then had a meal although the food was all wet but still good.  A "memorable" occasion.
