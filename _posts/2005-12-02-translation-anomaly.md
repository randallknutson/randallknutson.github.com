title: Translation anomaly
---
I was translating a friends letter the other day when I came across the word "berikan."  It stumped me at first because I thought it was based on the root word "ikan" which means fish and the prefix "ber" which means to make or wear.  So, the translation would be either to wear fish (doesn't make sense) or to make fish (as in like a chicken laying eggs).  I was stumped for a while until I realised the root word was actually "beri" which means to give and it has the suffix "kan" which transfers the object of a verb to something else.  So it should have actually meant "to give something."
