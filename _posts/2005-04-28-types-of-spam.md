title: Types of spam
---
I have some pretty good spam filters on all my e-mail but every once in a while I like going and looking to see what they are trying to sell me.  Here are some of the more common types of spam I receive:<br /><br />1. Viagra/Cialis... Gee thanks<br />2. Nigerian 419 Scam wanting to give me millions of dollars for using my bank account<br />3. Refinance my house, which I don't have<br />4. Viruses<br />5. Phishers trying to trick me into giving away a username and password<br />6. Pirated software<br />7. Help to improve my website<br /><br />My favorite type of <a href="http://www.spam.com">Spam</a> is a Hawaiian specialty called <a href="http://www.hormel.com/kitchen/recipe.asp?id=5088">Spam Musubi</a> but it comes in a can, not e-mail
