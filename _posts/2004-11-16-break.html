I haven't been doing a whole lot the last couple of days.  We had the first vacation in almost two months of school.  It is also Idul Fitri which is the night of power for Islam kind of like Christmas.  Everyone goes home and gives gifts, then asks for forgiveness.  I've been reading, relaxing and getting small chores done that I haven't had time to do in a long time, like cutting my hair and buying soap for the laundry.  Very relaxing.  I also went to see the Incredibles.  Funny movie.  I'd give it a 7 out of 10.
<br />
<br />It is almost time to decide for next year on whether I am going to stay or not.  I'm almost sure about my decision now but I am going to give it a few more days to make sure.  I'll let you all know when I have turned in the letter.
<br />
<br />Please forgive all my sins against you, internal and external.
