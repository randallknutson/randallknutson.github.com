title: Indonesian Bomber Killed
---
In East Java today the main guys behind most of the major bombings in Indonesia, including both Bali bombings, the J.W. Mariott bombing and the Australian Embassy bombing have killed themselves.  They were surrounded by police in a raid and blew up a bomb that killed them.<br /><br />This is a huge victory for Indonesia and the world.  These terrorists have caused major problems for Indonesia and the rest of the world and we will all be safer here without them.  For those of you who have never heard of Azahari bin Husin, he is kind of like Asia's Usama bin Laden.  <br /><br />They almost caught him a couple years ago when he was in Bandung.  We were really nervous when that happened because it meant he might be planning something there and there weren't a whole lot of western targets besides us.<br /><br />Read the <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/JAK8022.htm">Reuters Article</a> for more information.
