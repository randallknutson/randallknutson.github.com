After watching Fahrenheit 911, I had almost convinced myself that documentaries were not worth watching.  Then my friend gave me a copy of SuperSize Me!  I had heard it was good but I had no idea.  Morgan Spurlock made the whole think funny but extremely educational.  He had a question to answer made the film in such a way to answer that question.  Namely it was how much damage eating McD's 3 times a day for a month would be.  No one, not even the doctors and nutrition specialists had any idea how bad it would be.  Even his website is awesome.  Be sure to play the burgerman game!

<br />To sum up the movies for the week:
<br />Fahrenheit 911 - worst movie of the year (a documentary)
<br />SuperSize Me! - best movie of the year (a documentary)
<br />
<br />This has to be the year of the documentaries.
