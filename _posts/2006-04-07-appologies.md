Sorry I haven't been posting lately.  I've had a visit from a very special friend for the last week and I am very sad to see her go.  If you would like more information, feel free to e-mail me.  It's a good story.<br /><br />Lots of stuff coming up.  The inaugeration for Cot Aron will be on the 22nd and I've still got lots of big news about traveling to announce that I'm not going to promise when since I keep breaking the promises.  Stay tuned for lots of interesting stuff though.
