We have thoroughly enjoyed this trip and are glad to have shared it with you.  I'll try to keep posting to my blog about my life which is still interesting, at least to me.  I love hearing from all of you so please feel free to send me an e-mail anytime.<br /><br />Now I'm back in Dallas trying to set up my life again and get over jetlag.  So far I've gotten a cell phone (with 3G, internet and TV!), gym membership and am still looking for a car and job.  Its good to be home.
