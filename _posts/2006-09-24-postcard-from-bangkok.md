In spite of Bangkok being a backpacker's paradise, we were only there for a couple days.  One day really.  We just didn't have time to fit much in.  It is a big city though so we didn't miss a whole lot.<br /><br />We did go to the Grand Palace though.<br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/bangkok3-709117.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/bangkok3-705082.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />It has some very old and brightly colored palaces and temples that are very thai and unique in their brightness.  They were renovated not too long ago whith colored mirror pieces all over the place.<br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/bangkok2-791263.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/bangkok2-788279.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />For example, this giant golden stupa is actually covered with millions of one inch square golden reflective mirrors.  The effect is really cool.<br /><br />We also tried to go to the snake farm where they collect snake venom to make anti-venom but it was closed in the afternoon due to the coup.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/bangkok4-712793.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/bangkok4-709620.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Speaking of which, there were tanks and soldiers all over Bangkok and Thailand.  As we were leaving for Cambodia, they were all over the place and even had a few checkpoints along the roads.  Everything was calm though and no problems really anywhere.  <br /><br />On our way to Siem Reap where Angkor Wat is, we got caught in the bus scam.  We got on a bus that took 9 hours to do the 4-5 hour trip so that they could dump us at a guest house at 11pm and then we wouldn't go looking for another one.  Needless to say we marched off in a huff.
