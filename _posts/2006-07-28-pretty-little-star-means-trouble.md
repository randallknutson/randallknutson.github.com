title: Pretty little star means trouble
---
I've been a Mac user now for nearly a year and have hardly used a Windows computer since.  I was just downloading some software from Microsoft's website to play Windows Media Player files in Quicktime when I started noticing all these pretty stars all over the place next to software updates.  They are the same little silver stars that have started popping up on all my friend's Windows computers.  <img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/staricon-781922.gif" border="0" alt="" />  Apparently they have designed a very nice logo for their Windows Genuine Advantage program or whatever they are now calling it.  Basically if Microsoft thinks you are running a pirated copy of the program it will start notifying you and not let you upgrade parts of the system.  Problem is that EVERYONE I know is seeing this on their computer and asking about it.  I know that the machines purchased here in Indonesia probably have a pirated copy but even the ones that were purchased from HP, Dell, IBM and others in the US are doing the same things.  I'm so glad I'm using a machine from a company that doesn't treat its customers as criminals.<br /><br />Not only that but Macs are much safer to use.  Did you know that?  Read <a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20060727.html">this article</a> by  Walt Mossberg with the Wall Street Journal for an insight into the difference.  Why battle viruses, adware, spyware, trojan programs and spam when you can just <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/">get a Mac</a>?<br /><br />Are you stuck holding on to some programs that only run on Windows?  Good news!  Macs run Windows too.  That is if you want all the Windows Genuine Advantage, viruses, adware, blah blah blah that comes with it.  Not to mention that OS X is lightyears ahead of Windows in usability and creativity.<br /><br />I'll leave you with this.  There is a reason Mac users are fanatics.  Wouldn't you rather enjoy using your computer?
