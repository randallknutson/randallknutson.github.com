For dinner last night a whole bunch of us went out and suprised Andrea at Gambrinus (an Indian and German restaurant).  We ate Indian and it was really good.  The reason for the party was that it is the first day that she could walk with her cast since she had surgery this summer.  She almost cancelled last minute because she thought her wallet was stolen when she was swimming in the afternoon.  After she cancelled her credit cards she found it on her bed.  Dinner was great anyways.
