Last night I was shopping at the store that imports from around the world.  You can find all kinds of stuff there are thoroughly unreasonable prices.  I was looking at the shampoo selection and of course they had the basic kinds and some imports like Herbal Essence.  Then I saw a Japanese (I think) shampoo with the best name ever.  It is called "Fu Fa Poo" shampoo.  I'm still laughing.
