Here in Bandung (pronounced <span style="font-style:italic;">ban</span> as in flan and <span style="font-style:italic;">doong</span> with a sound like pool only different consonants) it has been raining very hard for the last month or so.  This <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/detailnational.asp?fileid=20050225.D03&amp;irec=7">floods most of south Bandung</a> pretty bad every year but this year it is really bad.  We live up north on the slope of the mountains and so are pretty unaffected by water except for when the roads turn in to rivers.  In fact, I have a theory that the roads are just dry creek beds that they have  tarred over.  Anyways, in the south, apparently someone has been piling garbage into a huge mound instead of disposing of it properly.  Right now it appears that some of the <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/detailnational.asp?fileid=20050225.D01&amp;irec=5">city garbage</a> has been dumping there instead of the official garbage dump to skim a little money off the pot.  Well, the garbage got really wet and collapsed like a landslide or an avalanche and cover a neighborhood or two.  Right now about <a href="http://us.rediff.com/news/2005/feb/23dump.htm">160 people are dead</a> and it is estimated that the garbage was traveling at up to 250 Km/h.  Hopefully the government will fix the problem and prevent a tragedy like this from happening again.
