Last night I was out riding my motorcycle around dusk when all the bugs are out.  They always fly in my helmet, which I can't close at night because it is tinted, and then buzz around my ears.  The bats are also out eating the bugs.  They always amaze me because they will zoom right beside you but always manage to miss.  Anyways, last night one must have had a cold or something because I ran smack into him with my helmet.  1 down 1 billion to go.
