title: Have you ever traveled back in time?
---
I'm one flight away from arriving back in Dallas.  My next flight leaves Japan at 5:30PM and after 12 hours of flight arrives in Dallas at 3:30PM on the same day, which is two hours before it left.  How is this possible?  The only plausible explainations are first that we pass through a wormhole on our way that throws us back in time 14 hours, second that we fly close to the speed of light several thousand times around the earth and that allows us to travel back in time or we just crossed the international date line.  Personally I find the third option too boring to be possible so I'll leave it to you to figure out which one actually happens. <br /><br />I think it is clear I didn't sleep enough on the last flight.  At least they have free internet here in Japan!
