I'm giving up on my travel agent that I have been trying to get to issue the ticket for the last two months.  I was specifically trying to avoid having to wait until the last week or two to get the ticket so I started really early.  He assured me I was confirmed and so I asked him to issue the ticket.  Now it turns out that I'm not confirmed and I'm waiting for seats to open up.  Forget it.

<br />My friend Arvin found me a ticket that is about $500 more expensive but I can have it in hand in a day or two.  It is well worth $500 to me to have peace of mind instead of continuing to go through the nightmare of getting a ticket from the other guy.  Yay for Arvin!
