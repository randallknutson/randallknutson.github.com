We got hit by lightning again today.  Luckily this time it only took down our internet server (should be easy to fix), a network switch and one laptop.  It is kinda cool to be sitting by the servers, hear a loud pop followed by very loud lightning.  Doesn't take long to figure out what happened.  I'm writing this using the bluetooth and GPRS on my phone since the internet at school is still down.
