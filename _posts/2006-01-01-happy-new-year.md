title: Happy New Year!

Happy new year to everyone!  I've been having a very nice and relaxing time in Bandung and will leave early tomorrow morning.  I went to a hotel party with some friends last night to celebrate this momentus occasion.  <br /><br />It has been great to have some time to hang out with old friends (the ones that are still in town) and not have to worry too much about what is happening in Banda Aceh.  I'll soon be back though and ready to work.  Sorry for not posting more but I was on a break.
