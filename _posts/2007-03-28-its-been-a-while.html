I guess it has been quite a while since I last posted.  Thats what happens when you are engaged and getting used to a new job.  On a side note, I'm tired of Dallas traffic.  It isn't usually bad where I have to drive but when I go on client site, it can get really bad.  Yesterday I spent almost four hours in traffic.  Tomorrow I'm going even further but I'm going to leave very early to try and miss the traffic.  Oh, and I'm buying a toll tag so I can use the toll road to speed things up.
