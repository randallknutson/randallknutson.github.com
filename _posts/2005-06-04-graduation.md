Our graduation was really cool.  We had 12 seniors graduating this year.  Of them, 8 were honors graduates with a GPA above 3.5.  All of the seniors had a GPA above 3.0.  That gives you an idea of how good of a class they were.  <br /><br />Here is a breakdown of the nationalities of the seniors<br />5 Korean<br />3 American<br />1 Japanese<br />1 Taiwanese<br />1 Indian<br />1 Indonesian<br /><br />It was fun to see them going through this big step in their lives.  A few of them wandered back to school this saturday morning, I guess to say goodbye.  Seeing a senior on campus all alone swinging in a swing reminded me of when I graduated and the school just kept going but my life went elsewhere.  Good luck seniors.
