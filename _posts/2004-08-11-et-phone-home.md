A friend brought me back some Reese's Pieces and Peanutbutter Cups.  I have been enjoying these immensely.  M&amp;M has a factory around here somewhere so they are easily accessable but Reeses candy is impossible to find.  The other thing that is near impossible to find is Ranch Dressing.  One store even has Ranch free which is like Ranch only without the flavor.  You can get just about any other type of dressing, including Thousand Islands.  I believe that the dressing is named after an area of Indonesia name Pulau Seribu which means, Thousand Islands.  If you are wondering what everyone here craves, Reeses and Ranch.
