title: Be Ahead of the Curve On-line

<p>There are always lots of buzzwords floating around the internet these days.  Web 2.0, Social Networking, AJAX, Semantic Web...</p>
<p>We all want to make websites that are on the cutting edge which means figuring out what these buzzwords mean and how to implement them.  The good news is that Drupal not only is fully <strong>Buzzwords Compliant</strong> but it more often than not <em>defines </em>the buzzwords.  After going to Drupalcon this year and talking to all the other people I know who are working in Drupal it is really amazing to see the work they are doing.  Many of the sites that are creating buzz (and hence buzzwords) are built with Drupal.  Those that aren't built with Drupal could have been built with it easier and with less money.  There are examples of people making a Twitter clone, a Basecamp clone, a Youtube clone, a flickr clone and many others using readily available modules in Drupal.</p>
<p>Because Drupal is open source with a very active and talented group of developers behind it, new features and abilities are created nearly the same time as anywhere else on the web.  By building a website in Drupal you can stay on the cutting edge of web development and stay ahead of your competition.  You also pay less for the development because much of it is already done for you and contributed back to the community.  So by using Open Source, you leverage an entire community who are helping you stay ahead of the curve.</p>
