title: Fire! Fire!
---
We had a bit of fun tonight.  I was off at the beach celebrating a friend's birthday when I got a call from the bookkeeper saying that the house was on fire.  I was 45 minutes away and by the time I got back the fire was out.  Turns out the new internet that was installed today was the cause.  The wire was not yet properly tacked to the wall (that was going to happen tomorrow) and was tucked behind the electric meter.  Well, it shorted out the electricity and started the whole box burning.  Luckily the NGO next door had a fire extinguisher.  Within an hour the electric company and the house owner had shown up and fixed the problem.  I've got to say I was impressed with how fast they fixed everything.
