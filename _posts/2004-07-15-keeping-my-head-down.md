title: Keeping my head down
---
There were a couple of <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/detaillatestnews.asp?fileid=20040714124836&amp;irec=14">bombs</a> that went off yesterday in Bandung.  This has been a problem from time to time here but they are always pretty small and no one gets hurt.  I'm fine and everyone else is fine.  People say it was more smoke than anything.
<br />
<br />When I go back to the US many people ask me about how dangerous it is here.  My response is usually that it is not more dangerous than living in many other places.  The vast majority of the people here are very friendly and helpful.  There are a handful of people that want to hurt others but that is true anywhere you are.  Here they don't really target westerners since there are so few in the city.  Everyone who has visited has said they feel really safe while they are here.  All of the people in our neighborhood look after us and some became very upset when the Bali bombing happened and took it as their responsibility to guard us.  God can use any situation for good so I'm not worried about what will happen.  This doesn't mean I live reclessly but I don't have to worry.
<br />
<br />For now...  still keeping my head down in faith.
