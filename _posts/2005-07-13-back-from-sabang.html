Sabang was great.  The island was covered with old growth forest and surrounded by tons of coral and fish.  I drove my bike there and took a ferry across.  On the drive to the beach I saw several troups of monkeys, two huge (4-5 feet) monitor lizards, giant fruit bats and wild boars.  I stayed on the beach for $1.50 per night in a little bungalow.  I snorkeled the first day and did two dives the second day.  The fish were amazing here.  <br /><br />This island is only 200km from the epicenter of the earthquake and is very near to Banda Aceh where the damage was the worst in the world but only 12 people died on the whole island.  This is amazing if you go there because of how many people are near the beaches.  They said it was because the island is surrounded by deep water so the waves didn't really have time to form and because the were tall hills surrounding the island so you only had to run 5 meters to get out of the way.<br /><br />Another great place to visit in Sumatra.  Wow.
