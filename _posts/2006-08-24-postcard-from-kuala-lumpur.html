I decided that maybe the best way to keep all of you up on my travels was to send postcards from the different places I'm going with pictures (when possible).  Here is the first, from Kuala Lumpur.<br /><br />I've been in Kuala Lumpur for about a week and a half now and have been all over the city (mostly walking).  KL has some of the phenomenal eateries.  All very cheap too!  Its a mixture of Chinese, Malay and Indian food which is really spicy and good.  <br /><br />I've successfully gotten three visas so far.  China, Russia and Kyrgyz.  I wasn't able to get the Uzbekistan visa yet since we haven't gotten the Letter of Invitation yet (they are mad at the US so they are making it hard), or the Kazakhstan visa (it takes a whole week to get it and I don't have a week left).  We'll have to get those later.<br /><br />Here are some pictures from different places I visited that were photo worthy.  <br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/KualaLumpur1-748895.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:hand;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/KualaLumpur1-745679.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />This photo is of the Batu Caves.  They are a set of three caves just north of KL that you can take a bus to.  There are 272 steps leading up and a huge statue of some god sitting there.  The caves were okay with lots of little shrines around inside and lots of monkeys that are mean.  There was also a cave just to the left of this picture that went back 2.2km but I didn't go back since I've seen caves before and you had to pay to do it.<br /><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/KualaLumpur2-746464.jpg"><img style="float:left;cursor:hand;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/KualaLumpur2-742167.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Of course you can't go to KL without visiting the Petronas Towers.  This is the view from the top.  I must admit that I haven't been up them yet.  I just haven't felt the need yet.  Interestingly (at least to me), Petronas means Petrochemical Nasional which is the national gas company.  Gotta love what monopolies can afford.<br /><br />Sorry about the haze in the pictures.  Every year Kalimantan in Indonesia decides to burn down the entire jungle so the haze from the fires goes across to Singapore and Malaysia.  The haze in both pictures is from this.  There is no smell but it is like really bad smog.  There isn't a lot of pollution from cars here since most vehicles run on natural gas.<br /><br />Today I'm headed to Singapore to visit some friends.  I can't do any more visa work and I need to visit a port to get some ferry tickets from Medan to Melacca so I can get a visa to Indonesia.  More postcards to come.
