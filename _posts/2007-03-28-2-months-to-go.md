Less than two months until Ryanna and I are married.  For all of you who have married, I bet you remember what it was like at this time.  It will be nice when  we are married have a place of our own (not in my parents house any more, not that it is that bad).  Hopefully we will know soon where we will be living.  I'll let you know when I know.
