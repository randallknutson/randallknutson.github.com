Today is open house day at school.  What that means is that we have to stay at school till 6:00 PM and do lots of activities with parents.  I'm taking the group picture and everyone is wearing colored shirts because the theme is "MOSAIC."  We will arange in differnt shapes by colors on the gym floor and take an artistic picture.  We will also be playing some games, eating food and being available to talk to parents.  I can't wait to go to sleep.  I'm very tired from a busy week.
