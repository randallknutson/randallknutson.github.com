title: New Computer
---
I decided to go ahead and buy a new computer this week.  I bought a 12" Apple Powerbook.  Yes, I have officially gone over to the other side.  I've always been a little dissatisfied with Windows and have played around a lot with Linux over the years.  As I am needing to buy a laptop and wanted to get something good, I couldn't find anything that matched the features of the powerbook for ANY price.  Throw in that I get to play with Mac OS X and I'm sold.  I also bought an iPod even thought I don't listen to music all that much.  Maybe I'll start.  <br /><br />Anyways, I just got back from Meulaboh where I didn't really have a computer yet and there really isn't internet access so that is why I haven't written in a few days.  I'll be in Banda Aceh starting Sunday and back in Meulaboh for a while starting Tuesday.
