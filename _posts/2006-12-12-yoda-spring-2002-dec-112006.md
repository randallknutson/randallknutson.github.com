title: Yoda, Spring 2002 - Dec 11,2006

As you can probably tell from the title, Yoda didn't make it.  We went to the vet to visit him this morning and he could barely move.  In the two hours we were with him he only was able to lift his head three times and couldn't stand or wag his tail.  None of the medications were working so we decided it was time for him to go.<br /><br />The vet determined that his bone marrow wasn't producing red blood cells for whatever reason and that there really wasn't any chance of him recovering.   Ben was able to come down and say goodbye since it was his dog. <br /><br />We found Yoda when he was a mangy little puppy and instantly fell in love with the funny shaped puppy with one ear up and the other ear down.  He had his mischievous years but in the last year or so he was turning into one of the sweetest dogs I had ever known.  When I got home a couple weeks ago, I was excited to have such a good dog around.  Yoda, with his youthful playfulness, has also helped keep Buster healthy and more active. <br /><br />He will be very missed, especially since his life was so short.
