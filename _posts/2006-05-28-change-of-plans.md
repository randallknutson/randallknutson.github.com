Due to the recent earthquake in Jokjakarta, I've been asked to be on the immediate response team to the area.  I'm on my way there right now and will be there for the next three weeks.  This means that I will be postponing my trip to the US by two weeks.<br /><br />Also, this is my personal blog and I've tried to be very careful to not post anything sensitive to my work and I will continue to do so.  I'll continue posting information on how I am and maybe a little on what I'm doing but I need to be very careful about work related stuff since I am not authorized to speak for SP.<br /><br />Please be praying for the victims of the tragedy and those who are helping them.
