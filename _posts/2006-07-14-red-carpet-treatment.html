Our Canadian work team finished up and we headed to Medan yesterday.  When we landed, we picked up our bags and headed to the hotel.  Along the way were a million police and tons of government officials.  They got more and more dense on the way to the hotel.  When we got to the hotel, there was a red carpet and everything!  I mean, I knew we were doing good work but I didn't know we would get that kind of attention for it!  When checking in, they were really anxious to get us out of the lounge.  Turns out the President of Indonesia was coming to spend the night a the same hotel as us.  <br /><br />At one point I was in the lobby when he went out.  Turns out he looks like anyone else but just has a lot of other people running around him doing things.  He even has a car with a license plate that says "Indonesia 1."  <br /><br />So this morning I was going to go down for breakfast and the elevator stopped but was going up.  I decided to head up first since I was near the top floor anyways.  The elevator went to the top where the President was staying and they asked me to get out but there was no where to go.  So I was just waiting around for him to arrive and take the elevators.  Well, he was taking a while so I went and found the service elevator and took that one.  Didn't have to see him again thankfully.<br /><br />We got the Canadian team sent off without any problems this morning.  They did a great job and there were no major problems or complaints the whole time.  I'm going to have a nice rest now though.
