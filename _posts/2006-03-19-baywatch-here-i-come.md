title: Baywatch here I come
---
WE had a beach barbeque yestderday at a beautiful beach not too far from here.  I invited a bunch of people from other NGOs to join us and when we showed up on the beach, we found a makeshift lifeguard stand and two of my surfer friends standing guard over the beach.  They have decided to start lifeguarding and hopefully developing a lifeguard program since an average of more than one person a month dies at this particular beach.  When the food was ready, I took their place as lifeguard for a half hour while they got some food and socialized.  It was another awesome day at the beach and if you are wondering, no I didn't have to save anyone.
