I know I've ranted about the rain plenty recently but I had good reason to.  Apparently February set the record for rain fall in a month in Bandung.  Our school is build on the side of a hill and so has a retaining wall on each end, one holding the property up the hill off the school and one holding our school off the next property in a step like process.  The retaining wall at the bottom of the school started sagging about a week ago and we are in danger of losing the playground.  Here is a picture of them restoring the wall.  It looks like a ditch but on the right is actually a retaining wall that is sagging with a fence on top of it.  To the right of the wall is an 8 foot drop.<br /><br /><img src="/sites/default/files/blog/bl-retaining.jpg" />
