I preached my first sermon today.  It was on the topic of faith which is something that I am very passionate about which helps.  Whenever I try and give a speach about something I don't care about, it never comes out well but when I really care, it turns out really well.  Overall it wasn't a whole lot different than teaching in front of a classroom except there is less audience participation.  I got a decent amount though.  Asked lots of questions and got people talking.  No one was nodding off which was also good.<br /><br />The funny thing is that I don't think I was actually scheduled to preach this week but next week instead.  I had also signed up to be an alternate if someone backed out.  I was preparing for this weekend when I got a call yesterday asking if I could preach because the person who was going to preach had left the country.  I was a little confused because I thought I was already supposed to be.  The upside is that I was ready.  The downside is that I get to preach again next week.  I think I'll do love...
