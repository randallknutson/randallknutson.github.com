My grandpa kept his title as the comeback kid.  One of his kidneys has started working again and he even is walking around.  My mom said they may be releasing him from the hospital soon.  Everyone was so worried this time that all of my aunts and uncles went up to see him in the hospital.  Sounds like they had a great time together and with grandpa which was good.  Family reunions are great.
