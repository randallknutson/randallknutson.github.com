Fingernail clippers.  I've been traveling several times a week for the last couple months and haven't really had a place to drop all my stuff.  I try and keep a pair of fingernail clippers in my toiletries bag but I forget and put it in my carry-on instead of my check in.  Then when I go to fly again they get taken out and confiscated as a "weapon."  Come on.  It is WAY easier to kill someone with bare hands than with fingernail clippers.  Anyways, every time I want to use them now, either I'm in a place where I can't buy them or I buy them and immediately get them taken away.  Sheesh.  It is time to go buy another pair somewhere.
