My contract will be done in three weeks time.  It seems like I just got started.  It's amazing how fast one year goes by.  I just got back to Banda Aceh yesterday after seeing the Canadian team off in Medan.  My replacement is already here and I've been working to get him up to speed on everything before I go.  This morning I turned over my responsibilities to him so now I'm just an adviser to him until I leave.  Its strange to have someone else running the project I've been running for so long.<br /><br />Lots of things have happened since my last newsletter so I'm going to try and get another one out really soon.  Hopefully now that I have less responsibilities and the Canada team is gone I'll have more time.<br /><br />I'm also finishing preparations for the upcoming trip.  I'm getting really excited about that!
