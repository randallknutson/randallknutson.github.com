Apparently the first week after the earthquake there were over 500 aftershocks which is a record.  Funny thing is I haven't felt one and I know an earthquake when I feel one having lived in Aceh where there is one every couple days. <br /><br />Then there is Mount Merapi which is apparently around here somewhere and trying to blow its top.  I have yet to find the mountain and don't see any signs of it in everyday life here so I'm not terribly concerned.<br /><br />Color me an ostrich with my head in the sand maybe.  Things could chance in a hurry though.
