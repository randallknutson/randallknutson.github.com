title: Goodbye to my friend
---
A good friend of mine from College was killed about a week ago in an accident on a lake. His catamaran hit a high power line and he was thrown into the water. Jonathan Barr was a exceptional man with tons of energy, a passion for life and an overwhelming love for God.  We will miss you Jon.
