title: CCK Widget Programming with Measurement example
---
<p>For those who missed my presentation last night, you can <a href="http://docs.google.com/Presentation?id=dhhtdgbg_9fkjjxbdc" target="_blank">view it here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I'm attaching my example of a custom CCK widget which creates a basic distance measurement field.</p>
<p>Tom mentioned the hidden "Multigroup" module in CCK that allows grouping fields.  The CCK developers claim it isn't ready for primetime but he reports it works.</p>
