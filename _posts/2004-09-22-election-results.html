It appears that Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has won the election 60-40 over Megawati.  While this probably a good thing, it is also a nervous time.  Megawati is famous here for not doing anything.  A lot of people liked that.  The "founding fathers" were military dictators each for about 30 years that ruled with an iron fist.  Megawati was a big change in that she didn't rule much at all except to take a bribe now and then.  To be fair though, she did try and do a few tough things like remove the fuel subsidy but would always back down in the face of demonstrators.  After all, she was never elected.  She became president after fierce demonstrations.  SBY brings the promise of a strong and talented military leader but also the fears of a strong and talented military leader.  He has shown himself reliable and strong in the past but there are fears of a return to the military dictatorship of the past.  Time will tell...
