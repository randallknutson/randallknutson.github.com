I got to Medan yesterday and officially started my new job of Progam Manager, Livelihoods.  I spent most of the day meeting with people and learning the ins and outs of how stuff works at Samaritan's Purse in Indonesia.  I'll be spending the next three or so weeks with the current Program Manager, Livelihoods learning the ropes.  Monday I'll fly to Meulaboh and then back to Medan on Thursday.  Sunday I'll be flying back to Banda Aceh finally.
