title: Is 80% good enough for you?
---
<p>I've worked with many different CMS systems for the web.  I spent a lot of time in Dotnenuke and have worked with Typo3, Joomla, Mambo, Wordpress and many others.  I like to descibe them as 80% solutions.  Meaning it is really easy to make an "80%" great site in a very short amount of time.  The problem comes when you try to do something really amazing.  It is incredibly hard if not impossible.</p>
<p>One of the downsides of Drupal is that it is hard to do the first 80%.  This turns off a lot of people.  The great thing about Drupal though is that going from 80% great to 100% awesome is not only possible but pretty easy.</p>
<p>So are you going to be satisfied with a website that is mostly good or do you want a website that is, in the words of Rhino, AWESOME!</p>
