Last night my  mom made potato rolls for dinner and they were delicious.  While we were eating them, I asked why she made them and she said, "Because we had some leftover mashed potatoes and it makes the rolls light and fluffy."<br /><br />I replied, "I thought the potatoes make the rolls thick and heavy."<br /><br />And my dad said, "I thought the potatoes are added for flavor."<br /><br />So why are potatoes added to potato rolls?  I guess we'll never know.  They sure were good though.
