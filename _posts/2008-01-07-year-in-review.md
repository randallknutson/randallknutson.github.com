I haven't posted much in the previous year, so I thought I would do a wrapup to try and catch up a bit.<br /><br />As many of you know, I got married to Ryanna Urban on May 26th.  We had a wonderful honeymoon in Victoria, BC Canada and arrived back in Dallas to move into our apartment and begin our CARES program there.  The last 7 months have been wonderful being married to such an amazing woman.  Each day gets better and better.<br /><br />In July we went up to Colorado to go to a friend's wedding.  The groom was a roommate of mine when I was in Indonesia and the bride is the sister of Stephen, who I went on the long trip through Asia with. <br /><br />Next I went to a training session at Sage software in Scottsdale, AZ for a week and Ryanna was able to join me for the last half of that trip. <br /><br />In December we went up to Portland and Seattle for Stephen's wedding (yes, the same Stephen!) and to meet more of Ryanna's family since they are in that area.  We had a great time.<br /><br />The business is going well.  We've got lots of consulting jobs going on right now that are keeping food on the table and we are working on putting out some products soon that I will fill you in on soon.<br /><br />Our power went out at 11:55PM on December 31st so we had a new year celebration by candle light.  We could see lots of different firework displays from our apartment which was good because it was really cold outside.<br /><br />Now I'm enjoying following the presidential elections (finally I'm enjoying it!  They started WAY too early).  I have no idea who I am going to vote for yet but I'm enjoying the intrigue.<br />I'll be posting more now so stay tuned for more.
