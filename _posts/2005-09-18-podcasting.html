About a month ago I finally broke down and bought an iPod.  I've never been a huge music person so to spend $300 on a device that plays music seemed a little silly to me.  I actually bought an Mp3 player about 6 years ago for an outragious amount of money and have been hugely disappointed with it (most recently because it isn't supported in Windows XP).  I went ahead and bought it anyways and a few days ago decided to find out what the buzz was about podcasting.  <br /><br />I have to say I really love podcasting.  Basically, anyone on the internet can publish a "radio show" that will automatically be downloaded to your computer and iPod.  While this is cool, it isn't enough for me to be that excited about.  What I found when I was poking around in the iTunes podcast directory though was hundreds of churches with their sermons online.  All I have to do is subscribe to the podcast (free) and every time they release a new one it automatically downloads to my iPod.  I can then listen to tons of great sermons whenever I want.  I can also hear random people talk about anything.  Exciting.
