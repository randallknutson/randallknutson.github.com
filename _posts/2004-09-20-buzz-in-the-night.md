We are now beginning the wet season although it isn't raining very much yet.  One of the side effects of this is that all the mosquito larvae that have be hibernating for the dry season have decided to hatch at once.  It seems like every night for the last 4 nights our house is filled with mosquitos.  We have this electric racket that you can use to kill mosquitos but it seems that no matter how many we will there are still more flying around.  I've killed about 20 each night just in my room and I still get woken up by the buzzing of mosquitos near my head.  Hopefully this won't last too long.
