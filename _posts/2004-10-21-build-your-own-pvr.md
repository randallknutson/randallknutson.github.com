title: Build your own PVR!
---
This last week I've been fascinated with the idea of building my own PVR.  For those of you who don't know what that is, think Tivo or Direct TV.  I've been doing a lot of research, mostly on <a href="www.byopvr.com">BYOPRV.com</a>.  I've found all the hardware I need to get.  The hardest part was getting the TV Guide onto the computer.  I found a website where I can download the Guide for Indonesia in an Excel worksheet.  I then wrote a program to translate it to the proper XML format.  Now I know I can get it in.  I'll let you know how it all works once I get it set up.
<br />
<br />Maybe if these things are cool enough, I could sell them.  I don't think anyone else in Indonesia has one yet.
