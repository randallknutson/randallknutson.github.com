<div><div>After our time in the fergana valley, we headed up to Bishkek. Bishkek turned out to be one of the most beautiful big (1 million people) cities we have ever seen. There are trees and parts everywhere and the roads are really wide. We stayed with some friend's of a friend's parents. What made it really fun is that they didn't speak any english! That didn't stop them from being super hospitable and showing us all over town.  One of the coolest things at their house is that they had a sauna instead of a bath! They made us take a sauna every night and it is amazing how addicting a sauna can be in cold weather.  I would be tempted to install one in the US if I wasn't going back to Texas.</div><br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/Bishkek-738542.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" alt="" src="/sites/default/files/blog/Bishkek-737311.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /><div></div><br />All in all, Kyrgyzstan is one of my favorite countries.  It wouldn't take a lot to convince me to move here.  The people are friendly, the cities are wide and beautiful and the natural beauty is stunning.  The economy is not real good which makes for cheap prices and lots of opportunities to help out.</div><div> </div><div>Next up we headed to Almaty.  We aren't planning on staying long before heading to Moscow.</div>
