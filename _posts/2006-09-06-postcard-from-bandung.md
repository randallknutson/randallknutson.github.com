title: Postcard from Bandung
---
As most of you know, I lived in Bandung for three years only a little more than a year ago so my time here is kind of like a reunion/final farewell.  I've spent most of my time at the school where I taught and many of my friends are still here although it is interesting to see how many are now married or seriously dating someone.  <br /><br />Anyways, to start things off, here is a picture of the gate at the school.  <br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung1-734363.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung1-727198.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />I did some substitute teaching for various teachers including 8th grade bible.  I really like teaching bible and wish I could do it more often.  I also did junior high chapel on friday.<br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung2-713129.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung2-797945.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />I had a great time relaxing in Bandung and hanging out with old friends.  I even got to help design the new lab at the new school that is under construction now.  Now for a little bit about Bandung and some sightseeing.<br /><br />Bandung used to be called the "Paris of Java" or the Paris of the East.  Back when Indonesia was a dutch colony, Bandung was a resort and relaxation city for citizens of Jakarta trying to escape the heat.  It saw rapid growth after independance and was the center of Indonesia's textile market until the crash in 1998.  Still, many textiles are made there (check out the labels next time you go to the store).  There is one particular outlet street called Cihampelas (chee-amp-las) that has gaudy facades in front of all the stores.  Unfortunately I haven't taken any pictures of them yet.<br /><br />All you texans out there would be interested to learn that Bandung is a sister-city of Fort Worth.<br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung3-746675.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung3-744732.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />I've seen this monument for four years but have never gotten around to taking a picture of it until now.  Next time I am in Fort Worth I'll have to find a similar monument.  If anyone knows where it it, please let me know.<br /><br />Because Bandung was a rest city up in the mountains away from the heat, there are still many Dutch colonial villas around the city.  There is also still tons of classic Dutch architecture.<br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung4-785452.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung4-783197.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />And of course next door is something a little more... um... modern.<br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung5-760224.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung5-748419.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Bandung also has the Kimia Farma plant right in the middle of the city which is where the world's supply of Quinine was made for hundreds of years (maybe not that long).  Quinine was the primary anti-malaria drug used for a long time despite the fact that you almost died from the side-effects.  They have much better drugs now, not to mention that malaria is much more treatable than it used to be.<br /><a href="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung6-741575.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="/sites/default/files/blog/bandung6-727708.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />That does it for Bandung.  I'm leaving tomorrow morning to spend a day in Jakarta with more friends, then heading to Medan for a day to pick up Stephen, then to Kuala Lumpur.  More to come.
