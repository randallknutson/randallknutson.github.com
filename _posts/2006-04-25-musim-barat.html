The musim barat has definitely started now.  Litterally translated it means the west season.  Banda Aceh is on the east end of the Indian Ocean so the west season means really strong winds, big waves and no fish.  The day will start out normal and around 1 or 2 in the afternoon a huge gust of wind will come with rain about 5 minutes later.  The wind has to be 50-60mph.  Yesterday it blew the roof off our motorcycle shack and today it nocked out the power.  Its still off and we are running off of UPS.  The wind also makes it difficult to play ultimate frisbee.
