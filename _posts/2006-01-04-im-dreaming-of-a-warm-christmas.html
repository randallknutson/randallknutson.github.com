This one goes out to all of you snowed in this winter from all of us who have spent so many years in the tropics at Christmas time.<br /><br />The clouds are cov'ring, the snow is deep,<br />The pine and oak trees sway<br />I've never seen such a day,<br />But it's December the 24th<br />And I'm longing to be down south<br /><br />I'm dreaming of a warm Christmas <br />Just like the ones I used to have <br />Where the palm trees glisten, <br />and children listen <br />To hear waves crash in the sand <br /><br />I'm dreaming of a warm Christmas <br />With every swirling winter storm<br />May your days be merry with corn (okay, I was at a loss here.  Make a suggestion and I'll fix it)<br />And may all your Christmases be warm <br /> <br />*Special thanks for inspiration to my sister Valerie who wrote on my Christmas card, "Merry Warm Christmas"
