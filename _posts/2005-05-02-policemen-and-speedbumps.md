title: Policemen and Speedbumps
---
The Indonesian word for speed bumps is polisi tidur which literally translated means "sleeping policeman."  I laugh every time I hear or say the word because I always picture a policeman lying down on the road asleep as I zoom over him on my bike.  <br /><br />On the subject, has anyone else ever noticed how much the highway patrol and highway bandits from the middle ages have in common?  Both hide along the side of roads, waylay passers by and take their money.  Why do we put up with it?
