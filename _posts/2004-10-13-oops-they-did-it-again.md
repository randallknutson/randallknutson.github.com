Microsoft today warned of more serious security vulnerabilities in Windows and Internet Explorer.  See <a href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+warns+of+22+new+security+flaws/2100-1002_3-5406550.html?tag=nefd.top">this news article</a>
<br />
<br />Basically, if you are using Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows 2003 or Internet Explorer (the big blue "e" you click on for the internet), you need to get some updates before you get another virus.  Head over to <a href="http://www.windowsupdate.com">Windows Update</a> and get all the relevant patches or enable Automatic Update from the control panel.
<br />
