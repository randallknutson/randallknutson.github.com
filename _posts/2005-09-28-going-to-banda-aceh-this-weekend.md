title: Going to Banda Aceh this weekend
---
It looks like I will be in Meulaboh for a while longer so I've decided to go get my motorcycle and move it down from Banda Aceh.  I will fly up there this friday and drive it back down on Monday.  This is the stretch of road that gave me so many problems last time.  I've heard that the road is supposed to be in better shape now.  No telling though.  I'm more prepared now than I was before.  I can also stop by in Panga and check out how the Agriculture project is going.
