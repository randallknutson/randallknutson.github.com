The drama is comming along nicely.  The stage is painted and the second floor has been built.  It is going to look really nice though.  We are still working on putting in the four doors and the fake door and window.  Practices are continuing after school and are going well.  All the students have their lines down but we still have a lot of pauses to remember them.  Two weeks and counting till performance.  I just have to make it till then.
