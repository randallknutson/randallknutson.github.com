title: Tankuban Parahu
---
Since monday was election day we had it off of school.  A few friends and I wrote motorcycles up to the volcano called Tankuban Parahu which means "upsidedown boat."  There is a local legend of a guy who falls in love with his mom or something like that and as a punishment he has to do something.  It ends with an upside down boat which is what the mountain vaguely looks like if you have an incredibly active imagination.  Anyways, We had a blast hiching most of the way around the rim, boiling eggs in a hot spring and walking past all the people trying to sell us stone elephants or strawberries.  I guess you have to experience it to fully understand.  After we were a little tired, we went to a hot spring resort with some really nice hot spring pools.  We ate some corn on the cob on the way there and lounged around in the pools for a while.  For some reason the men here consider it manly to be able to wear a speedo.  I think it is just gross.  Anyways, on our way back, we stopped at a restaurant and ate rabbit and goat sate.  It really is quite good.  I love taking people on this trip.  My parents went on it when they were here this spring and just loved it.  The scenery is incredible and the food is out of this world.  Anyone who wants to come here and visit I will definitely take them on this trip.
