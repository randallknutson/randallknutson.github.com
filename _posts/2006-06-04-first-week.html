We've now been here in Jogja for a week and working non-stop since we arrived.  Most days have been 18 hour days which is why I haven't been posting (or sleeping) much.  Today we are taking a break since even God rested on the seventh day.  I haven't even had time to answer very much e-mail but hopefully will be caught up today.  <br /><br />Things here are starting to get better.  Most of the disaster area is a line from a ways south of Jogja to north east of the city.  For some reason the homes in this area were almost all destroyed.  The houses are generally lightly fired brick houses with mud for mortar.  Generally there is no rebar in the walls and the roofs are clay tiles held in place by gravity.  Driving around, almost every building has had some tiles fall off and the houses that were destroyed were the mud and brick walls collapsing under the weight of the tile roofs.  Many people were injured by the tile roofs falling on their heads.  <br /><br />People are starting to set up tarps for temporary shelter and receiving lots of food from relief organizations.  This will be great for the short term but in the long term, there are a lot of people who have lost their houses and their livelihoods.  There is one village we are working in that was completely destroyed with over 500 houses.  There is no longer a local economy so how can the people rebuild?  Unfortunately it doesn't appear that enough money is coming in to rebuild the houses for the people but hopefully they can be trained in how to make a better and safer house in the future.<br /><br />Tomorrow we'll continue our operations which consist of the distribution of tarps for shelter, blankets, stoves, buckets and tools and many other essential items for keeping them more comfortable while living in tents which will be a long time while they rebuild.<br /><br />Check out the Samaritan's Purse websites for lots of pictures and information on what we are doing (check out the international sites as well as they have other pictures as well).
