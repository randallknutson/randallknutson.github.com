title: Sailing Away
---
I finally gave away my sailboat today.  I've had it since around my sophomore year of high school which would be well over ten years ago now.  I decided that it wasn't worth keeping around any more since I probably wouldn't be using it all that much for a long time.  It was also in pretty rough shape.  I posted it on Craigslist and within about 15 minutes I got 3 responses and then pulled the notice.  The first guy decided not to get it and the second guy came and picked it up.  He is in a family that likes to sail catamarans and was very happy to get it.  I hope it works out for him.  Either way, it is no longer my responsibility.  Oh, my dad is also very happy that the space beside the house is now free.   What does he plan on doing with it now?  Why putting a new fishing boat there.
