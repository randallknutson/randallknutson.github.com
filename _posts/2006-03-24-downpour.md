It has rained straight the last two days which wouldn't be that big of a deal except that first, its the dry season and second carpenters don't tend to build cement houses when it is raining.  So we haven't gotten a lot done and all the roads are turning back into mud.  I'm sure there willb e some flooding as well.<br /><br />The folklore for Aceh is that if it starts raining Thursday afternoon (which it did), it will continue raining the whole weekend (which is has so far).  We'll see what it looks like.  I was planning on going to the beach on Saturday and playing ultimate frisbee before church on Sunday.<br /><br />UPDATE: Apparently I've gotten it wrong.  If it rains all day friday (which it has), it will continue to rain all week (we'll see).
