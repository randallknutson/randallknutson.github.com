There seems to be a lot of news stories right now talking about God vs. science in the news.  I really hate it when people pit God against science.  <br /><br />First it implies that anyone who believes in God is not scientific.  This is despite the fact that modern science was started primarily by Christians wanting to explore God's natural laws to their fullest extent.  People who believe in God are not idiots who don't believe in science.  The debate should actually be classified as God-science vs.  We-don't-know-science since non-God scientists can't explain where science, matter and the natural laws came from.  Now who is believing things without knowing where they came from?
