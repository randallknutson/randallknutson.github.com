I'm in Bengkulu right now.  It is on the west coast of Sumatra a days journey south of Padang.  I've spent the day laying at the beach and sightseeing.  Everything is going well and I will leave for Padang early tomorrow morning.  The drive through the mountains from Muara Enim was terrible and slow all morning but good in the afternoon.  Tomorrow the road is supposed to be good and straight.  We'll see. I'll post more when I can.
