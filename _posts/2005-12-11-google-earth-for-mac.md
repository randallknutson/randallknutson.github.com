title: Google Earth for Mac
---
As some of you know, I bought a laptop about 4 months ago and I decided to go with a Mac.  I've absolutely loved it but the one thing that was missing was <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>.  For those of you who haven't yet used it yet.  It is one of the most stunning and useful tools you will come across on computers today.  I've been planning another motorcycle trip with a friend and was wanting to use Google Earth to help map out the trip but couldn't because it doesn't run on a Mac!  A couple of days ago, a Beta of Google Earth became available.  I'm awed by what I can do with it.  I've been looking for something like this for planning.  I should be pretty far along in planning in a week or two so I'll let you know more about the trip then.  Suffice to say, it will make my last trip look like a trip to the store.
