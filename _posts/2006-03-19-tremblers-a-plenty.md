I don't know what happened but after a couple months of relative calm, we've had about 5 small earthquakes in the last 3 days that I have felt.  There was also another tsunami in an island somewhere in central Indonesia that killed a few people and destroyed some villages.  Haven't heard a lot more on that though.  I hope this isn't leading up to anything major.
