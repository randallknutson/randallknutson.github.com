Happy Independence Day all you Americans out there.  It has been non-stop parties out here for the last couple of days.  I went to one Friday, Saturday, skipped one yesterday and have another tonight.  Things will probably slow down though after the 4th.  It is fun to enjoy the holiday with Americans and non-Americans.  Enjoy the weekend!
