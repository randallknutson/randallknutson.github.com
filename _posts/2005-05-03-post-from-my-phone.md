title: Post from my phone.
---
<p class="mobile-post">I am posting this from my cell phone. It was rather difficult to<br />figure out but is working now. I'm using my Sony Ericsson T630<br />connected using GPRS to the internet and then gmail with<br />gmailwireless.com to send an email to my blogger.com address. Pretty<br />cool.<br />Why would i want to do this? Well, the plan is to be on the road this<br />summer where there is no internet so i want to use it to keep you up<br />on how the trip is going.</p>
