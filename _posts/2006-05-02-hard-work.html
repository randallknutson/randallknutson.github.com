This is the second time in my life that I've had to fire someone.  I had to fire two people today and I really don't like doing it.  The first time I had to fire someone my supervisor was there and helped me do it.  He gave me some very good advice.  That is, if you are going to fire someone, make the decision ahead of time and don't allow yourself to change your mind.  It is very true that I always want to change my mind when I am doing it.<br /><br />These guys were guys I really did like and I didn't want to fire but I had to.  Not a fun situation.
