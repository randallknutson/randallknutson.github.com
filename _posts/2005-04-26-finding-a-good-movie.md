title: Finding A Good Movie
---
I watched Finding Neverland last night.  What an awesome movie.  Johnnie Depp knows how to pick really good movies.  It seems like I have really like every movie he has ever been in but they all haven't been huge hits.  He is probably the most underrated actor in Hollywood.  Finding Neverland was probably his best film yet.  It is about James Barries and writing Peter Pan.  If you haven't done so already, do so as soon as possible.
