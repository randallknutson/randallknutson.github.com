title: Hooked on Sudoku
---
A little over a year ago, my dad mentioned a game called Sudoku and said that it was really fun.  I didn't have time then to try it out but I was bored the other day and decided to find some trivia and mind games.  I ran across <a href="http://www.braingle.com/games/sudoku/index.php?play=1">Sudoku</a> on Braingle and have become hooked.  If you've never heard of it before, there is a grid 9x9 and the object is to fill all the cells with numbers 1-9 such that each row, column and 3x3 sub-grid only has one occurence of each number.  It's amazingly addictive.  Plus it's like a workout for the mind.  Gotta keep that muscle in shape.
