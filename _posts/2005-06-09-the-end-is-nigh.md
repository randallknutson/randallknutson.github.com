Today is the last day for exams.  I've finished grading everything, taught my last class and proctered my last exam.  Now all I have left is field day tomorrow and then I'm officially unemployed.  I've really enjoyed these last three years teaching but at the same time I'm ready to go do something else. <br /><br />Tomorrow is kind of special for me because it will be the first time in 21 years that I will not be involved in education.  I'm excited.  There are some interesting prospects opening up too.  I'll let you know more when I do.
