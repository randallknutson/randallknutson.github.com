Last night I was making <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_26469,00.html">lefse</a>, a traditional Norwegian Christmas food (my family is of Norwegian decent).  In the process of making it you have to get your hands pretty full of mashed potatos.  In order to clean it off I tried to turn the sink on with my arm, since my hands were soo full of potatos.  I accidently broke off the faucet.  Luckily a quick switch turned off the water pump and stopped the flood but then we can't take showers and do all the other things you do with water.  Of course I had to fix it, at least so it wouldn't leak.  I started working and in the process broke the pipe further into the wall.  Ah!  Okay, time to bring in the professionals.
