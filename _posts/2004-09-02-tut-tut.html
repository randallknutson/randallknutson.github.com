It rained last night for the first time in a few months.  It rained again this morning.  Methinks this betokens the beginning of the rainy season.  The wisdom here is that any month with an "r" in it is a rainy month.  Rain here happens the same almost every day.  In the morning it is sunny and cloudless, different from other rainy places like Vancouver or Seattle where it drizzles all the time.  It slowly clouds over during the day and around 3:00 PM it starts pouring.  It rains hard for about half an hour then leds up to a steady drizzle for a couple hours.  You can almost set your watch by the start of the rain every day.  Unfortunately, we teachers are allowed to leave at 3:30 which is prime rain time.  Since I ride a motorcycle home it makes for an interested and wet ride.
