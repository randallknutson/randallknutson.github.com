How hard can it be to nail Jello to the wall?
<br />
<br />Thats about as hard as it is to buy a plane ticket here in Indonesia.  It costs nothing to reserve a ticket until about two weeks before the flight so almost all the flights are always booked until the week before, then everyone cancels.  Those who have been waiting for a seat can then purchase tickets.
<br />
<br />I thought I had reserved my ticket well in advance and have been trying to get it delivered for the last month and a half and have finally found out that my ticket is not confirmed yet.  I have three weeks to go and still not ticket.  Hopefully I will be able to get one though.  If not I will be pretty upset.  I really want to go home for Christmas.
