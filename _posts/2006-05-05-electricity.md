title: Electricity
---
Its the small things in life that give you pleasure.  Today we moved our electricity connection from the end of one line to the end of the other line.  We were having lots of trouble with our electicity getting too low of voltage to run things.  Indonesia is standardized on 220V and our house was getting between 160V and 180V.  The big AC in the office wouldn't work below about 175V and the smaller ACs would stop working at about 170V.  Now with the new connection we have about 200V at the house right now during one of the daily lows.  The ACs are working great and hopefully things will run less hot.<br /><br />Now we need to drill a well so our water isn't swamp water anymore.  Wouldn't that be nice.  Still dreaming of hot water though.
